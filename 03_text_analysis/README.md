# Text Analysis Workshop Materials

This folder contains the materials for the workshop on Computational Text
Analysis. It conains a set of files, outlined below:

* `sotu.tsv`: This is a tab-separated file containing the text corpus which you
  can use throughout the lab. It contains four columns, title, author, date, and
  the text.
* `NLP_Workshop.ipynb`: This is the first Jupyter Notebook that contains the
  basic text analysis exercises. It involves reading text, calculating TF-IDF
  scores, a topic model, and word embeddings.
* `AL_Workshop.ipynb`: This is the second Jupyter Notebook that contains code to
  perform Active Learning using a RoBERTa Large Language Model (LLM).
* `NLP_workshop.Rmd`: This is an RMarkdown file containing the same instructions
  as the first Jupyter Notebook, but implemented using R libraries. You can use
  them similarly to the Jupyter Notebook.
* `_solutions`-files: These files contain the full code including the solutions.
  Use them to guide yourself to implementing the correct code and seeing how the
  methods are implemented.
