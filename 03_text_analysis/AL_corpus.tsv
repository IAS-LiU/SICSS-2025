1958	This disser­ tation is the major result of that projeot.
1958	It is the aim of this disser­ tation to traoe the bibliographic development and oorporate history of the Encyclopaedia Britannioa, and to present a publishing history of a work whioh spans one century and extends well into two others.

1958	Without his professional guidancethis dissertation oould never have been completed.
1958	, This study as here presented is the story of the Enoyolopaedia Britannioa as I saw it, from its serial beginnings in 1768 to 1943 when its present form of continuous revision became operative.
1958	Therefore, from among all others who have given,guidance and assistance, only I can be charged with the full responsibility for the form and presentation this study has finally taken, and the interpretations refleoted herein.

1960	Mrs. Israel gave skilled help in preparing I.B.M.
1960	data cards.
1960	Mr. John S. Richards, retired librarian of the Seattle Public Library, deserves a paragraph all his own.
1960	In a course given at the University of Illinois in 1959, Mr. Richards pointed out topics in public library adminis�* tration that needed research attention.
1960	He took a personal interest in the progress on my study and gave invaluable assistance in providing voting data for the Seattle Public Library bond issue elections.
1960	I can only hope that the end result is worthy of his reading*
1960	The general subject of this thesis had been in the writer's mind for some time, and some reading had been done in the field.
1960	It was, however, in a discussion with Dr. Rudolph H. G-jelsness, Chairman of the Department of Lib­ rary Science, that the suggestion was offered which brought the.field into focus for a research problem.
1960	An observation by Dr. Howard MeClusky, Department of Hdueation, arose as a source of stimulation which eventually made it possible to recognize, outline, and proceed with the present thesis topic.
1960	He had nointed out the imoortance of achieving agreement on 18 the image of the public library in adult education.
1960	Dr. Mary Carter and Dr. Wallace Bonk,^Department of > Library Science, gave a considerable amount of their time  both during the development of the subject content of the study and subsequently in revisions, and especially in point­ ing up several passages.
1960	After a great deal of careful perusal and consultation with committee members, a first working draft of the questionnaire was ready for pretesting.
1960	Using such tools as the books by Payne19 and Good and Scates,20thequestionswerepolishedupinphraseology.
1960	In this phase of development, Dr. Charles Metzner, School of Public Health, made some valuable suggestions as well as helping focus the rating scales for analysis.
1960	In developing the problem under consideration, the guide to research by Good and Scates was valuable.
1960	This book, follows the basic sequence of problem-solving: formula­ tion of a problem, survey of the literature, selection of an appropriate method for gathering evidence, and the analysis of data.
1960	Two other studies served as illustrations of the problem-solving pattern.
1960	One of these was the study by Gray 21 and Sogers, Maturity in Reading.
1960	to identify constellations of unifying factors and a concep­ tual framework within which to interpret reading behavior.
1960	Another illustration for a direction of action was found in the Public library‘InquiryTs approach to public library objectives, specially described by Robert Leigh in the Public Library in the United States: First was a review of library history to locate the librarian's traditional sense of purpose.
1960	Second was a synthesis of the statements of, public library objectives promulgated in recent years by official Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.
1960	Further reproduction prohibited without permission.
1960	These researchers attempted   library leadership.
1960	This combined statement of current objectives was verified by submitting it to a representative sample of librarians and was .
1960	?
1960	found to reflect a consensus of librarian opinion.
1960	Much valuable advice and assistance has been received from members of the doctoral committee.
1960	While expressing my gratitude for their recommendations, the responsibility for the final arrangement is my own.
1960	I am indebted to all members of the committee who have been so thoughtful and considerate in their suggestions for improvements in this worm.
1960	A special note of thanxs is due Miss Muriel Fuller, Michigan State library, who served as a special adviser for relations with individual public libraries.
1960	In conclusion, I must say that this study has been a particularly fruitful "learning experience" for myself.
1960	Usin the discipline of the social scientific method has had a most salutary effect upon my own concepts of library adult educa­ tion.
1960	In a field where vagueness and generalizations pre­ dominate, it has certainly been a rewarding experience to "live with" library adult education until a disciplined technique emerged for studying the attitudes of practicing librarians.
1960	It is a particular pleasure to acknowledge the assistance given by several individuals.
1960	Pre-eminent among them is Professor Raymond L. Kilgour whose encouragement and patience made the completion of t h i s study possible and whose extensive knowledge of the history of printing and publishing saved the author from making several embarrassing blunders.
1960	ii   To Assistant Professor Russell E. Bidlack special thanks are due for the.kind donation of much assistance and time.
1960	Professors Rudolph H. Gjelsnoss and Richard C. Eoys made many valuable suggestions.
1960	Mr. William Henry Stokes read the preliminary draft; his critioiems were always pertinent.
1960	Mr. Robert G. Carter courageously assumed the onerous task of proof-reading the final copy.
1960	Dr. Harriet C. Jameson, the Rare Book Librarian of the University of Michigan, advised the author of the existence and location of a letter from William Buchan to William Strahan.
1960	Two fellowships, granted by the Horace H. Rackhan School of Graduate Studies, enabled the author to spend the academic year 1958- 1959 in England initiating this study and the academic year 1959-1960 in Ann Arbor, Michigan, completing it.
1960	To his Alma Mater the author gratefully acknowledges his deep indebtedness.

1960	Behind any project which extends over a long period of time and which comes as the culmination of a phase of one's professional experience, there are many persons who in some way have contributed to the ultim ate realization of the project and thereby have earned an endless debt of gratitude.
1960	It is impossible to thank, or even to identify, many of these persons but it is hoped that Providence will in some way provide the opportunity to express this gratitude either directly or indirectly to all concerned.
1960	The investigator owes a special expression of gratitude to those who were more immediately concerned with the project from beginning to end.
1960	The study would never have been commenced without the generous permission and interest of her Superiors0 The efforts involved could never have been sustained without the loving and understanding interest and prayers of her Sisters in religion who so graciously assumed extra duties to free her for more concentrated work on the project.
1960	The person having the investigator was her advisor, Service, Columbia University, greatest influence on the work of the Dr# Frances Henne of the School of Library Without her constant encouragement and guidance it is doubtful whether the findings would ever have appeared in the present form.
1960	Her interest and the thoroughness of her supervision taught the investigator much about the qualities of a good teacher, A special word of thanks should be expressed to Miss Hilda Grieder, also of Columbia University, for her helpful suggestions while serving as reader of the manuscript and for her helpfulness in seeing it through the final stages of revision.
1960	The writer is also grateful to the principals, librarians, teachers, and students of the sample schools for their coopera­ tion in the study.
1960	To the many at Columbia University, School of Library Service who made the work there pleasant and profitable and to the com­ m ittee who so graciously examined her on the project, Dean Jack Dalton, Dr, Alice I, Bryan, Dr. Winifred B. Linderman, and Mr, John M. Cory, the investigator is most grateful.

1961	It seems appropriate at this time to also publicly acknowledge the w riter’s indebtedness to family and friends whose patience and under­ standing have contributed toward making the writing of this thesis a re­ warding experience.
1961	It is a pleasant duty to thank the many persons who have helped me in this dissertation.
1961	My greatest debt is to my thesis advisor Dr. Harold A. Lancour, whose advice, encouragement, and fruitful criticism have been of immeasurable benefit.

1961	My thanks go out also to the other members of my committee, Dr. Robert B. Downs, Dr. Thelma Eaton, Dr. W illiam V. Jackson, and Dr. Donald E. Strout, who were kind enough to read the original drafts and to offer valuable suggestions.

1961	My friends and colleagues at the University of Wisconsin Library School deserve real thanks for their understanding and forbearance, fore­ most its Director, Professor Rachel K. Schenk.
1961	I am also much indebted to Mrs. Ouida Taylor for her constructive interest while typing the final copy.
1961	Need­ less to say, I alone assume responsibility for the ideas and conclusions reached.
1961	ACKNOWLEDGMENTS I should like to express my appreciation to Dr.
1961	Hose Phelps for suggestions offered during the preparation of this thesis and for reading the first draft.
1961	I especially wish to acknowledge the helpful services of Kiss Isabel Grant and the Bare Book Boom staff of the University of Illinois Library.
1961	I am also indebted for publications borrowed from the libraries of Columbia University, Harvard College, the University of Chicago that loaned all the volumes of the Annals of Europe, the University of Virginia, the University of North Carolina, and the Library of Congress.
1961	Any substantial work of a historical nature of necessity involves the help of many people.
1961	The biography of Charles Evans is no exception to this rule, and I am happy to have this opportunity to express my apprecia- tion to my family, friends, fellow doctoraF students, and professional colleagues upon whose lives this work has intruded during the past five years.
1961	They have listened, criticized, suggested, and advised with a toler- ance which is a tribute to their good nature.
1961	Three, however, are of special importance and it would be difficult to say whose contribution has been most valuable.
1961	Each has been invaluable in his own way, and without their aid and encouragement my task would have been an almost impossible one.
1961	Dr. Leslie W. Dunlap originally suggested the writing of the life of Charles Evans and was responsible for my initial contact with the Evans family.
1961	His own conviction that the biography would be an important contri- bution to library literature has often spurred me on when my research seemed to move at a snail's pace.
1961	Thanks to his constructive criticism, I have avoided many pitfalls; and I am sincerely grateful for the personal interest he has taken in my work.
1961	',.,� Mr. Eliot H. Evans, elder son of Charles Evans, has manifested an-interest and helpfulness in the progress of the biography which was be- yond all expectation.
1961	When the proposal that I write the biography of his father was first mentioned to him, he entered into the project with the full determination that I should be offered every assistance.
1961	Through his   efforts the family papers were shipped to the University of Illinois for my research, and he has invariably responded promptly and cheerfully to my nuT'jrous requests for additional data or for another personal interview.
1961	The open handed way in which he has made available his own personal papers bearing upon his father's life has been gratifying.
1961	He and his brother, Charles Evans, Jr. , provided a grant for a research trip in May, 1958, to the major eastern libraries in which Charles Evans did much of his work.
1961	Although he and other members of the family have taken great interest in my research and have read the manuscript while in progress, they have granted me complete freedom in the use of the papers and have not suggested how I should use them in interpreting the bibliographer to my readers.
1961	For all these reasons my indebtedness to Eliot Evans is great and I am happy to record my appreciation here.
1961	Most writers pay perfunctory tribute to their wives in the preface of their work.
1961	There is nothing perfunctory about the genuine appreciation I feel for Robbie Lee Holley'p help on this thesis.
1961	As I look back upon the period it has taken to bring the biography to completion, I am amazed that she has been able to read the original drafts, make suggestions, and type the reading draft despite the appearance of Gailon Boyd in 1957, Edward Jens in 1959, and Amy Lin in I960.
1961	The inroads on her life have been many during this period, and I am all the more grateful that her patience and perseverence continued to the end, In addition to the above three, Charles Evans, Jr. , and Mrs. Gertrude Evans Jones, the other two surviving children of Charles Evans, IV   have cooperated with me in a fine way.
1961	Dean Robert B. Downs has borne with me sympathetically as I attempted to complete the thesis while carrying a full-time job as Librarian of the Education, Philosophy, and Psychology Library at the University of Illinois.
1961	To my staff, Pearce Grove, Ralph Stenstrom, Mrs. Grace Yeatter and Mrs. Barbara Meador, I am grateful for relieving me of some of the more tedious and time-consuming aspects of day-to-day library work without complaint.
1961	My thanks also go to many other people: to Dr. Clifford K. Shipton and Dr. Clarence S. Brigham of the American Antiquarian Society, Dr. Lawrence C. Wroth and Mr. Thomas R. Adams of the John Carter Brown Library, and Dr. Walter M. Whitehill of the Boston Athenaeum, whose willingness to talk with me about Evans and his work added much to the completeness of the biography.
1961	The late Arthur Parsons, Jr. , first of the Omaha Public Library and then of the Enoch Pratt Free Library, answered my plea for help from those institutions when I would otherwise have failed.
1961	About midway in the writing of the biography it was my privi- lege to meet Dr. William L. Williamson, whose biography of William Frederick Poole is easily one of the outstanding biographies of a librarian now available.
1961	I value highly my correspondence and conversation with him.
1961	In almost all of the libraries with manuscript materials as listed in the bibliography, there are at least two or three staff members to whom I am indebted.
1961	Although I do not mention them personally here, I hope each will feel that he or she is personally covered in this final word of sincere "Thanks. "
1961	The author wishes to thank the many persons who have helped her in the preparation of this dissertation by givingtheirtimeandencouragementandcooperation.
1961	It is not possible to list the names of all who have endeavored to help, but at least a few deserve special mentions Dr. Lester Aaheim, Dean of the Graduate Library School| Miss Christine Reb, Reference Librarian at Harper Library and Lecturer in Librarianship at the Graduate Library Schoolj Mrs. Shirley F. Harper, Librarian of the A. G.

1961	ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS  The research for this paper led -to interesting  libraries and many kind people.

1961	A particular note of  (  appreciation is due to Miss Mary Finch who, called back from  a vacation to the havoc created by a fire in the Foreign  Literature Centre, Toronto, yet found time amidst paint pots  and carpenters to discuss service to New Canadians.
1961	Mr. James  W. Pilton, then Librarian of the Department of Citizenship and  Immigration, Ottawa, provided me with much valuable intro  ductory material not available in the United States.
1961	These and other librarians and friends have contri  buted information, helpful suggestions and criticism.
1961	The  burden of the latter, however, has fallen on my adviser, Dr.  Leon Camovsky.
1961	Only through his firm guidance, kind patience,  constructive criticism and unstinting help has the work sur  vived numerous changes in approach, scope, purpose and format.
1961	To him x owe a debt of gratitude impossible to repay.

1964	It is customary to acknowledge the assistance of some - vil -    persons "without whose help this study could'not have been completed#" In.
1964	the present case, it is literally true that the high school librarians of Nassau County, New York, made this study possible# As will be seen in the chapters that follow, they donated rather astonishing amounts of their time to this research, always with the unfailing courtesy in which librarians everywhere take such justifiable pride.
1965	The investigator takes this means of gratefully acknowledging indebtedness to the Graduate School of Library Science of the University of Illinois, and particularly to the Doctoral Committee: Doctors Rob- ert B. Downs, Herbert Goldhor, Harold Goldstein, Rolland Stevens, and Clyde Snider.

1965	During the time the research was being pursued the contacts with Mr. Villere' were frequent enough that    a warm friendship has developed between him and the writer.
1965	Much that is written about the Creoles of Louisi ana is pure fiction, hence a keen sense of perception is required to sift the facts.
1965	Men such as Mr. Nott and Mr. Villere" are able spokesmen for their race.
1965	The writer also interviewed Mr. James Bezou who not only gave stimulating advice but in turn suggested other Creoles who either owned libraries or were well informed about Creole culture.
1965	Among them were Mrs. Lionel Durel, Mrs. Benton P. Babin, Mr. Rene LeGardeur, Mrs. George LeGrand, and Mrs. Paul M. LeGrand.
1965	Among the librarians who aided in the research were Miss Essae M. Culver, State Librarian of Louisiana (now retired but still in that position at the time this project was carried on); Miss Nell Lynch, Librarian of Louisiana Room, Louisiana State University; Mrs. Rosa M.

1966	ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Anyone who writes a dissertation�in fact, anyone who gains an education�must inevitably and happily find himself beholden to many people.
1966	I am deeply indebted to many friends, personal and official, who contributed in many ways to this undertaking.
1966	A few of them are named here.
1966	I shall always look back in gratitude and admiration to Dr. Robert B. Downs, Dean of Library Administration at the University of Illinois, for his strong support, friendly encouragement, patience, and�above all�his constancy.
1966	Especially in the last year of writing, when conditions outside the thesis pressed so hard and were so unset- tling as to discourage me from going on, he was a source of strength and stability.
1966	My thanks go also to Dr. Frances B. Jenkins and to the seven other members of the faculty of the University of Illinois who served at one time or another on my thesis committee.
1966	Most of the work was done at the Georgia Institute of Tech- nology, my undergraduate Alma Mater and since 1950 my professional home.
1966	Georgia Tech, through its excellent library and computer facilities, provided essential support for an undertaking of this kind.
1966	The Insti- tute, in addition, paid my salary for the 1949-1950 year of residence in Illinois and, through its Engineering Experiment Station, provided financial support for the early stages of the investigation.
1966	Accord- ingly, my thanks go especially to the following members of the Georgia iv   V Tech administration: Dr. Paul Weber, Dean of Faculties; Mrs. J. Henley Crosland, Director of Libraries; Dr. James E. Boyd, formerly Director of the Engineering Experiment Station; Mr. Robert J. Kyle, formerly Head of the Technical Information Section of the Engineering Experiment Station; and Dr. William F. Atchison, Director of the Rich Electronic Computer Center.
1966	The resources of the Georgia Tech Library in chemis- try, statistics, library and information science, and Russian materials served the needs of the thesis admirably.
1966	On occasion, however, I resorted to the collections of the Emory University Library, the Univer- sity of Illinois Library, and the Library of Congress, where I was always served courteously and competently.
1966	It was invaluable, to one writing a thesis in absentia, to have expert consultants close at hand.
1966	I am grateful for the suggestions, comments, and technical assistance of the following Georgia Tech faculty members, of various specialties, who generously contributed their time and thought as consultants or readers: the late Dr. John H. MacKay of the Rich Electronic Computer Center; Dr. Joseph J. Moder, formerly Pro- fessor of Industrial Engineering; Dr. William W. Hines, Assistant Pro- fessor of Industrial Engineering; Dr. Waldemar T. Ziegler, Regents' Professor of Chemical Engineering; and Dr. Graham Roberts, Chief of Readers'Services,GeorgiaTechLibrary.
1966	Iamindebtedalsotoasub- stantial number of librarians, computer people, and other members of the faculty and staff of Georgia Tech who, in the line of duty or in a spirit of helpfulness, assisted or advised me in various ways.
1966	I wish to thank also those friends�Dr.
1966	and Mrs. Andrew Lasslo, Dr. James Gough, colleagues, neighbors, and others�whose friendly and   sympathetic interest was a constant encouragement.
1966	Finally I acknowledge an unrequitable debt to my beautiful wife, Caroline, who for five years has cheerfully done almost double duty in bringing up our two lovely daughters while at the same time helping to preserve in her husband a moderately cheerful disposition.
1966	To Susan and Cathy�one of whom can scarcely remember, and the other has never known, what life without thesis was like�as well as to Caroline, I pledge a future with more evenings at home together, more family outings, real vacations, and other good things which most people think should be a part of family life.

1966	The need for such a study stems from inquiries into the locus of responsibility for public library support and development which have oc curred with increasing frequency in the deliberations of Canadian librari ans since 1956 when federal aid for public libraries was provided in the g United States.
1966	These inquiries have pointed up the lack of research on the best means of extending library aervice to rural areas and the problem of responaibility for aupport at the three levels of government: municipal, provincial, and federal.

1985	Chapter I A ccreditation, Evaluation and Change Statement of the Problem The world of academic librarianship is changing rapidly as a result of the introduction of new technologies, fluctuations in funding, and changes in the nature and status of library personnel.
1985	Librarians must learn to adapt to new circumstances if they are to succeed.
1985	As a result, library administrators must be capable of developing a clear understanding of the strengths and shortcomings of the library program and must be able to transmit that understanding to those who work in the library.
1985	This process requires the use of evaluation tools.
1985	These evaluation tools are specialized instruments.
1985	A proper understanding of them is required if they are to be used w ell.
1985	An evaluation of an organization is designed to produce a clear assessment of what is going on in it and to suggest possibilities for improvements in its program.
1985	Beyond that, the specific capabilities of the process are dictated by the design of the procedures that are used, the intentions of the people who commissioned the study, the willingness of members of the organization to cooperate with it, and the interest of its audience in seeing that its recommendations are implemented.
1985	This study will look at a specific kind of evaluation that Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

1985	Page 2 Is generally referred to as regional accreditation and w ill focus particularly on the process as it is applied in institutions affiliated with the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (hereafter referred to as the Southern Association or SACS).
1985	It w ill show how this institution-w ide process is used in libraries and demonstrate the impact it can have.
1985	More specifically, it w ill look at the standards and procedures designed by the Southern Association for the evaluation of institutions of higher education to determine how those procedures influenced change at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University.
1985	To provide a backdrop against which this and other evaluative tools might be judged, it will examine in detail how accreditation is expected to work in organizations of higher education and how those expectations are fulfilled.
1985	Regional accreditation is designed to help institutions identify areas in which change is required and to assist them in making those changes.
1985	Yet little research has been conducted to determ ine accreditation's capacity to meet these objectives either in the institution as a whole or in components of the institution.
1985	While the library receives substantial attention in the accreditation self-study and its staff devotes much energy to this process, little has been done to determine the impact of the process on library operations.

1985	Page 3 This study investigates the capacity of the Southern Association to induce change in libraries in member colleges and universities.
1985	The objectives of the study are (1) to examine the literature of program evaluation and organizational change to establish the relationship of these concepts to accreditation, (2) to provide a model against which accreditation's effectiveness in an academic library can be judged, and (3) to compare the techniques used during reaccreditation studies in the libraries of two institutions to this model.
1985	In meeting the last objective, the author w ill attempt to assess the impact that the accreditation process has on individual libraries by examining the way the process actually works as compared to the way proponents expect it to work.
1985	Finally, the study w ill identify areas in the operation where accreditation can effectively encourage change; those in which its capacity as a change agent could be enhanced; and those in which alternative evaluative procedures might be more appropriate.
1985	The Philosophy of A ccreditation Voluntary accreditation is a procedure developed specifically to meet the needs of American colleges and universities.
1985	It is a system of quality assurance based on the premise that the diverse institutions of higher education in the United States can best be evaluated through a process combining self-evaluation and peer review.

1985	As a general rule, self-regulation of institutions is preferable and in the long run more effective than external regulation.
1985	2.
1985	Any system of external regulation can be effective only to the extent that it recognizes and builds upon a community�s willingness to engage in self-regula tion.
1985	3.
1985	A substantial number of individuals and institutions will regulate themselves if they know what behavior is expected and why.

1985	An overwhelming m ajority of individuals and institutions will regulate themselves if they believe that they might otherwise be identified by th e ir peers as doing something wrong.

1985	Only a small number of individuals or institutions deliberately engage in behavior that they know is not in the public interest (p. 144).
1985	Historical Background Accreditation is relatively new to American higher education.
1985	Until this century almost anyone could start a college in the United States and operate it with little outside interference.
1985	But in the last quarter of the nineteenth century some of the leading in stitu tio n s of higher education became concerned about the uneven quality of American education.
1985	Representatives began meeting to discuss these concerns and to find appropriate solutions to the problem.
1985	As a result of these meetings, six regional associations were formed: the New England Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools (1885), the Middle States Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools (1889), the Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner Further reproduction prohibited without permission.
1985	Page 4   Page 5 North C entral A ssociation of Colleges and Secondary Schools (1895), the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (1899), the Northwest Association of Secondary and Higher Schools (1917), and the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (1924).
1985	These groups first assumed the task of identifying high schools that provided adequate preparation for college work.
1985	However, the associations soon began to evaluate colleges as well and to publish lists of those meeting their standards.
1985	The first list of this kind was published by the North Central Association in 1913.
1985	Other regional associations followed the North Central's lead.
1985	The first list of colleges accredited by the Southern Association was published in 1919 (Selden, 1960).
1985	Over the past seventy years, voluntary accreditation has become a fix tu re in the governance of higher education.
1985	According to a Delphi study completed by Jerry W. M iller in 1972, accreditation is generally seen to serve two functions.
1985	First, it identifies for public purposes educational programs that meet established standards.
1985	In so doing, accreditation protects both the public and the community of higher education from inferior institutions.
1985	Second, the accreditation process serves to stimulate improvement in institutions through the application of standards and through a process by which faculty and staff of the institution are included in an ongoing process of self-evaluation, institutional research and planning.

1985	Page 6 self-evaluation and external assessment.
1985	The first is represented by an institutional self-study conducted by committees of people from within the institution.
1985	The second step consists of a v is it to the campus by representatives from other colleges to insure that the self-study accurately reflects conditions on the campus and that campus operations meet the standards of the association.
1985	The Self-study Dudley V. Yates (1976) found that most librarians serving on visiting teams believe that the self-study is by far the more important part of the process.
1985	In the South, this self-study may include either a comprehensive evaluation of the institution or a nontraditional study focusing on a single aspect of the University program.
1985	In either case, the study is conducted under the direction of a campus-wide steering committee.
1985	This steering committee may call in consultants to assist it in its work, but the bulk of the study is conducted by subcommittees drawn from within the institution.
1985	These groups represent a cross section of the campus, and each is expected to study a particular part of the university's program.
1985	When the work of the subcommittees is finished, a report is filed with the steering committee.

1985	Page 7 findings into a general report that accurately reflects the conditions on campus and that can be used to support institutional planning for the next ten years.
1985	The steering committee report is sent on to the Southern Association, where it provides the basis for the Association's decision to send a visiting team to the campus.
1985	If done properly, the self-study process can take from seven months to tiro years of intensive committee work to complete.
1985	The Visiting Team Once the self-study is finished, the Southern Association staff determines whether it is adequate to support an evaluation of the institution.
1985	If it is, a visiting team is selected that includes one person for each important area of the program of the institution under study.
1985	These evaluators are administrators or faculty members working in sim ilar programs in comparable institutions.
1985	One of the visiting team members is a librarian.
1985	The visiting team is expected to validate the self-study conducted by the university and to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of its programs during a three-day v is it to campus.
1985	The members of theteam and its chair are selected by the Association.

1985	Page 8 programs.
1985	For the library evaluator, this generally means talking to the library director, the library committee, members of the library staff, and other people on the campus who have an interest in the quality of library services and collections.
1985	At the end of the visit, the impressions of team members are compiled and a verbal report is made to the president of the in stitu tio n .
1985	This report outlines recommendations and suggestions that will eventually be included in the formal report of the team.
1985	At the end of the visit, institutional representatives are provided an opportunity to ask questions about the findings of the team on an informal basis.
1985	The Commission on Colleges Subsequently, the team files a formal report with the SACS Commission on Colleges, and that body is asked to make a decision about the accreditation of the institution.
1985	Prior to its final decision, however, the Commission asks the institution to respond to any recommendations made by the v isitin g team.
1985	This allows the university a last opportunity to say what it is doing to overcome shortcomings in its program and to outline points at which it disagrees with the findings of the visiting team.
1985	The self-study, the visiting team report and the institutional response are all considered in the final deliberations of the Commission.

1985	A ccreditation and the Library During the accreditation visit, the library is given considerable attention.
1985	William E. Troutt (1978) noted that the standards of virtually all of the associations reflect an appreciation of the need for a good library.
1985	The Southern Association, as noted above, includes a librarian on each visiting team.
1985	All regional accrediting groups pay close attention to the adequacy of library collections and services in their standards and evaluations.
1985	In fact, Herbert V. Ferster (1971) found in his content analysis of accreditation reports from the Middle States Association that the library was one of six areas most often cited in recommendations of v isitin g teams.
1985	But, despite this attention, questions have been raised as to the impact acreditation has on library programs and collections.
1985	The U tility of A ccreditation At the heart of the matter is the question of the continuing validity of the accreditation process as an evaluation tool.
1985	There is general agreement that accreditation once served a useful purpose, but not everyone is convinced of its continuing u tility (E llio t, 1970).
1985	Much has been w ritten in this debate recently, but little research has been produced to support accreditation's claims of effectiveness.
1985	Even less is available on accreditation's impact on individual components of academic institutions.

1985	Page 9   Page 10 the relationship of accreditation to the library has related to changes in the standards of the various associations and in the standards of the Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL), a major division of the American Library Association.
1985	ACRL standards are frequently used to supplement those of the regional associations in the evaluation of academic libraries, and they are sometimes believed to have a greater impact than accreditation itself.
1985	A ccreditation Standards In 1959, Alan D. Covey analyzed the standards of the Western Association, those of the National Commission for the Accreditation of Teacher Education, the ACRL standards, and a new set of standards that were being considered by the California State Commission on Accreditation.
1985	He concluded that the most useful standards are those that combine quantitative and qualitative criteria; that seek to evaluate the quality and appropriateness of the book collection; that concern themselves with the quality of the library building; and that assess the role and status of the librarian in the academic community.
1985	He recommended that the schedules used for the evaluation appear in a questionnaire format.
1985	The schedules should serve the institution by providing guidelines for the self-study; the accrediting agency by providing information to facilitate informed judgments; and the state by encouraging diversity within Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

1985	Page 11 higher education.
1985	According to Covey, schedules should be explicit and should provide information that is germane to the evaluation process.
1985	The standards should be unbiased, and the studies that arise from them should be economical to conduct.
1985	Standards should also reflect attitudes that correlate positively with other measures of institutional excellence.
1985	Above all, the evaluation of the library should be made within the context of the institution as a whole.
1985	Covey concluded that the primary standard against which the library should be judged is its capacity to support the university's academic programs.
1985	The Question of Effectiveness While studies like Covey's give guidance as to how accreditation should function, they provide little insight into the question of the effectiveness of the process.
1985	The measuring of effectiveness is particularly difficult, especially when one considers the two basic functions of accreditation.
1985	On the one hand, accreditation establishes the reputation of the university for quality.
1985	It is understood to signify that the university has clearly stated goals; that these goals occupy a legitimate place in the context of higher education; and that university programs are effective in meeting these goals.
1985	On the other, the process is expected to be an evaluation that is critical enough to help schools make needed changes in their programs.
1985	To do that, it must clearly specify areas in which these objectives are not met.
1985	Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.
1985	Further reproduction prohibited without permission.
1985	Page 12 These two functions are often in conflict.
1985	For accreditation to serve as a change agent, the self-study prepared by the institution must be a critical analysis, and the university must present itself for close scrutiny by both internal and external study teams.
1985	The self-study must be designed to identify areas of the program that are less strong and so that it can help the institution develop strategies for improving those areas.
1985	But the first objective of an institution is survival, and caution dictates a less than candid approach when the results of the evaluation are to be presented to an outside audience.
1985	And, as Kenneth Ashworth (1979) noted, the problem is compounded by the rewards that are attached to accreditation.
1985	A failure to gain reaccreditation can lead to the loss of governmental support, students, and faculty, and losses of this kind can force even reasonably strong institutions to close.
1985	As a result, questions must be raised about the willingness of marginal institutions to disclose their weaknesses to the accrediting bodies.
1985	Therefore, the internal objective (self-improvement) can conflict directly with the external objective of the the Southern Association (quality assurance).
1985	Ashworth (1979) noted that the problem is complicated by the fact that more prestigious universities are becoming less willing to provide leadership for the regional associations.
1985	These institutions know that they are in little danger of losing their Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

1985	Page 13 accreditation, and their interest in the regional associations has declined.
1985	He is concerned that soon many of these institutions may not be willing to invest the time and energy required to make accreditation a profitable exercise when there is no possibility of disaccreditation.
1985	A ccreditation and Quality Assurance in Higher Education The most reasonable approach to the questions relating to the effectiveness of the accreditation process is to separate the quality assurance function of accreditation from its use as a mechanism for fostering change.
1985	Quality assurance was the first reason given for the development of the accreditation process, and regulation remains a major concern of the various associations.
1985	S till, several questions have been raised about how well the process performs this function.
1985	The first question relates to the kind of standards that should be used to evaluate in stitu tio n s. A ccreditation has been designed to fa c ilita te the assessment of diverse groups of institutions.
1985	As a result, the standards have become increasingly qualitative and broad in nature.
1985	Each institution is expected to establish its own goals, and, once those goals have been accepted as valid, they become the primary benchmark against which the in stitu tio n is judged.
1985	While the peer review portion of the process insures that the academic program fits within the broad framework of higher education, the standards themselves are very general.

1985	Page 14 conservatively, and the values that are used are likely to be those of older, more established institutions.
1985	Lloyd H. E lliott (1970) contends that this procedure is ill-suited to the rapidly changing world of higher education.
1985	While he admits that accreditation has accomplished much in the past, he holds that it has now outlived its usefulness.
1985	E llio tt feels that accreditation has proved helpless to protect society third-rate programs and that its conservatism serves inflexibility into the educational system.
1985	Alan Pfinster (1973) is not quite so negative in While he agrees that examining boards may not be w illing or able to deal with radical departures from tradition, he believes that the fault for their seeming rigidity does not lie entirely with the accrediting agencies.
1985	Pfinster contends that accreditation visits to more innovative campuses often entail situations in which "the examiners are unwilling to accept something as being good just because it is new and exciting, and the college can't understand why the questions all seem to be based on a non-sympathetic and traditional approach" (p. 20).
1985	While the results of this confrontation in values may be frustrating to the innovator, Pfinster views this kind of conservatism as healthy for the organization.
1985	He contends that skepticism is a major judgments that result are, therefore, highly subjective.

1985	function of any process that is designed to insure that innovation in higher education is undertaken responsibly.
1985	A second question relating to the effectiveness of accreditation deals with the qualifications of the people performing the evaluation.
1985	As Pfinster (1973) noted, the premise is that "any person from any reasonably good institution can evaluate any other program" (p. 20).
1985	Discussions of the capacity of self-study committees to do their work have centered on the sort of qualifications that should be expected in members of the visiting team.
1985	Gerald Baysore (1971) concluded that examiners selected for visiting teams have already been identified as professionals in the areas that they are being asked to evaluate, and, therefore, it can be assumed that their work experience and professional competence have prepared them for the task that they are being asked to perform.
1985	While he noted that most associations do not have formal programs to train evaluators, he concluded that members of visiting teams generally understand their duties and are competent to make the required judgments.
1985	Dudley Yates' study (1976) of library evaluators on visiting teams in the Southern Association also noted that little training is given to team members prior to their v isits.
1985	However, he was less willing to accept professional competence as adequate preparation for an accreditation v isit.

1985	He called for additional training for visiting team members as one solution to this problem.
1985	This is not to say that there is anything like universal dissatisfaction with the accreditation process, at least for libraries.
1985	In fact, George Calvin Grant (1982) found that most librarians in the Middle States Association were not overwhelmingly dissatisfied with either the processes or criteria used by that group for the evaluation of libraries.
1985	But this might well be because they see the potential of using accreditation and its reports as a tool for justifying requests for additional resources.
1985	A ccreditation and Change Accreditation is also expected to serve as an agent of change.

1985	Paul Dressel (1971) was even more emphatic.
1985	He contended that "Self-study is wasted effort unless It serves as an agent of change" (p. 288).

1985	This is not to say that there is no comment in the literature attesting to the capacity of the process to facilitate change.
1985	John Dale Russell (1950) contended that "the accrediting associations have been responsible for enormous improvement in the quality of the service in higher education in this country "(p. 84).

1985	Further evidence of the role of accreditation in the change process was found in a survey of the presidents of members of the Council for the Advancement of Small Colleges conducted in 1977 by Brent Poppenhagen.
1985	Poppenhagen found that ninety per cent of his respondents felt that accreditation visits had been helpful in bringing about change in their institutions.
1985	He noted that they were perceived as particularly helpful in matters relating to general administration and decision-making processes.
1985	On questions relating to the impact of accreditation on innovation, more than half of the respondents said that the process had a positive impact on their capacity to make changes in eight of the fourteen categories listed.
1985	One should note, however, that only a quarter of the presidents felt that the process helped to look beyond traditional criteria for quality assurance.
1985	Almost eleven per cent said that the process retarded the development of newer measures of excellence.
1985	This eleven per cent represented the highest negative response to any question in Poppenhagen's study.
1985	This reaction by the presidents reinforces the perception that accreditation is a process that emphasizes a more conservative value structure.
1985	Poppenhagen's study also shows that the m ajority of his respondents fe lt that accreditation fostered change in all of the categories that related to the library (the Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

1985	In related research, Morris Gelfand (1960) found that librarians viewed accreditation as a stimulus to change.
1985	His study examined libraries that had recently been visited by the Middle States Association.
1985	He found that the process was generally perceived to have been helpful in this regard.
1985	The Change Process in Organizations Before looking further at the claims made for the role of accreditation in the change process, one needs to understand how organizations foster innovation.
1985	Studies of the change process have identified elements within organizations and the processes acting on them that enhance or retard their capacity to adjust to changing situations.
1985	In general, such studies relate to what J. Victor Baldridge (1972) calls the human relations school of management.
1985	Advocates of the human re la tio n s approach contend that there are two separate structures within any organization.
1985	The first, based on a formal, bureaucratic model, is designed to fa c ilita te the use of the authority of the organization's managers.
1985	The second structure is based on interpersonal relationships established among members of the organization.
1985	This informal structure allows individuals on each level of the organization's hierarchy to protect their own interests.
1985	People Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.
1985	Further reproduction prohibited without permission.
1985	Page 20 who stress the importance of this dual structure contend that, while change can be brought about by using the power built into the bureaucracy (the first or "formal" structure), it is more effective to take into account the values represented in the informal structure when making modifications.
1985	As a result, most change studies have attempted to analyze how innovation affects this informal structure and how changes can be introduced without placing undue stress upon interpersonal relationships within the organization.
1985	The Dill-Friedman Frameworks As a m atter of convenience, David D. D ill and Charles P. Friedman (1979) have suggested four models around which change literature can be organized.
1985	These are the complex organization model, the diffusion model, the conflict model, and the planned change model.
1985	One should understand that components of the change process do not break neatly into discrete packages.
1985	All of the elements identified in each model are related and have an impact on the entire process.
1985	Thus, any breakdown is artificial.
1985	Even so, the models offered provide a framework for examining the factors relating to the capacity of organizations to change.
1985	The four paradigms approach the change process from different directions.
1985	The complex organization model and diffusion models attempt to define those characteristics in the organization that either enhance or discourage change.
1985	The Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

1985	Page 21 complex organization model focuses on structural characteristics like the centralization of authority, the formalization of decision-making, and the size of the organization as predictors of the organization's capacity to change (Hage and Aiken, 1970).
1985	The diffusion model relates change to the cultivation of appropriate communications channels within the informal structure of the organization.
1985	Rogers (1962) and others feel that the capacity to adapt depends on the degree to which managers understand who in the organization can be used to spearhead reform and how those people can be influenced to assist in tailoring change to fit the values of the organization.
1985	In either case, these models focus on the need for assessing the receptivity of the organization to change prior to the introduction of specific innovations.
1985	This is accomplished through the use of surveys.
1985	The C onflict Model of Change.
1985	The third model presents a different view of organizations and looks primarily at the values operating in the process through which organizations innovate as opposed to preexisting conditions.
1985	The conflict or political model is based on the premise that organizational decision-making is a result of interaction among a variety of interest-groups operating informally within the organization and among the users of Its services.
1985	It contends that people within these interest groups join together in a variety of coalitions based on specific Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.
1985	Further reproduction prohibited without permission.
1985	Page 22 issues to insure that their interests are protected and to influence the policies of the organization.
1985	The political model suggests that conflict will be generated each time a change in policy is suggested, but its advocates suggest that this kind of conflict is healthy in that it unfreezes the coalitions in the organizations and allows for the introduction of new ideas.
1985	In the view of J. Victor Baldridge (1971), Ernest House (1979), and Jack Lindquist (1968), the major obligation of the change agent is to determine the nature of the interest groups operating in the organization, to identify the values of those groups, and to determine how each of them influences the decision-making process.
1985	In this way, changes can be phrased in ways that are more acceptable to those constituencies of the organization who w ill be affected by them.
1985	The main contribution of the conflict model is to introduce into the evaluation process a consideration of interpersonal relationships and the individual values that affect decision-making.
1985	The Planned Change Model.
1985	The last of the Dill and Friedman paradigms, and the one that most closely relates to most descriptions of the accreditation process, is the planned change model.
1985	This model develops a process through which change can be effectively introduced.
1985	It assumes an understanding of elements of the other three paradigms and uses this understanding to develop procedures through which change agents can make Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.
1985	Further reproduction prohibited without permission.
1985	Page 23 assessments of the organization.
1985	This model then outlines techniques for introducing innovations into the organization.
1985	Planned change is based on the work of David Clark and Egon Guba (1966), Harry Levinson (1972), and others and is often referred to as O rganizational Development (OD).
1985	One of the clearest statements of planned change was developed by Ronald Havelock (1972).
1985	Havelock outlined a process based on the premise that change takes place as part of a rational process that is continually going on in organizations.
1985	Change follows an orderly progression from research to development to dissemination to implementation.
1985	As a result, any appropriate change w ill be accepted in an organization (1) if the need for it can be established, (2) if the change itself is an appropriate response to the problem at hand, and (3) if the solution to that problem is presented to the organization in a reasonable way.
1985	OD proponents contend that the organization can best handle its problems through the use of a person or group of persons acting as a change agent.
1985	This agent can come from within or from outside the organization and may serve a number of roles.
1985	The agent may be the catalyst for change if that person creates the disturbance that begins the change process or that person may serve as the solution giver�the person who brings appropriate solutions to the organization.
1985	The change agent may also be a Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

1985	Page 24 process helper if the role taken is one of helping the organization to work its way through a problem solving process.
1985	That person may also be called to take the role of resource linker by connecting the organization to people and resources in its environment that are needed for problem-solving.
1985	In the course of the change agent's duties in the organization this person is expected to accomplish a number of things.
1985	F irst, a positive relationship must be developed with, members of the organization.
1985	Then, the change agent must help find a clear definition of the problems to be treated.
1985	It Is at this point that some kind of intervention begins.
1985	Usually this takes the form of a group-centered problem-solving process designed to find solutions to existing problems and to determine where changes in the organization might be helpful.
1985	Once the immediate cause of the intervention is dealt with, efforts are made to establish in the organization a continuing capacity for self-study and problem-solving.
1985	After accomplishing this, the change agent's job is finished, and that person withdraws from the organization or assumes another role within it.
1985	The planned change model describes a process in which a free exchange of Ideas is encouraged within organizations and an atmosphere of trust is created between superiors and subordinates and among peers.
1985	The process is expected to enhance the organization's ability to diagnose its problems, to find Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

1985	Page 25 solutions for them, and to facilitate the implementation of those solutions.
1985	However, the most important result of this process is to develop, in the course of a problem-solving exercise, a mechanism through which the organization can continue to study itself and to implant that process into the organizational structure.
1985	In this way, it is expected that planned change will improve the capacity of the organization to adapt to emerging situations.
1985	Planned change adds the idea that the success of change is at least as dependent on the process used to introduce it to the library as it is on other factors within the organization.
1985	When this sense of process is added to a consideration of preexisting conditions in the library and a consideration of the values of those who help make decisions for it, an effective process for introducing innovation into the organization will result.
1985	A ccreditation an^ the Change Models The process described in the Southern Association's Manual for the Institutional Self-study Program (1972) closely parallels Havelock's planned change model.
1985	By requiring a self-study every ten years, the Association fulfills the role of 'catalyst' by providing the rationale for a broadly based examination of the in stitu tio n 's operations.
1985	The accrediting agency is less successful as a 'process Helper', although it does provide standards, useful manuals, and a set of procedures for guidance.

1985	Page 26 While there may be an outside consultant to assist with parts of the self-study, the bulk of the work done in the evaluation is done internally.
1985	As a result, the importance of the outside change agent is minimal at best.
1985	At the same time, potential internal change agents can be constrained by the relatively conservative nature of accreditation.
1985	Periodic contacts with the Southern Association staff and the intervention of a visiting team can be helpful, but the absence of an impartial facilitator with a fu ll understanding of the process lim its the capacity of accreditation to influence change.
1985	The level of participation envisioned in the planned change model is insured in the accreditation process by the use of the committee structure.
1985	By delegating the study to a variety of faculty committees, an institution insures that many opinions are heard and that the sentiment of various elements on important issues can be expressed.
1985	This, in turn, serves to acquaint committee members and campus leaders with areas in which improvements should be made.
1985	This group can then help to make modifications more palatable and to sell changes to the larger university community.
1985	Broad participation can be particularly helpful in an area such as the library that is primarily a service area.

1985	During the process, the internal operation of the library tends to be examined by the library staff, while faculty and students look at library services.
1985	Often the library subcommittee consists of librarians, other library staff members, faculty, students, and administrators.
1985	In some cases, two separate subcommittees are formed, one with members from the library staff and the other with faculty and student representatives.
1985	In any case, the library staff and others combine to form what Havelock called an inside-outside change-agent team.
1985	Administrators in the library may act as consultants in the process, and experts from outside of the institution may be called on for specific expertise.
1985	But the bulk of the work is done by the library subcommittee^).
1985	Once the self-study report is produced, the official duties of the library committee are finished.
1985	But, if the study has been done well, this team can be used to help sell its findings in the univesity community.
1985	At best the work of the self-study committee should produce a group of people who have reached a consensus as to what the problems of the library are and what solutions might be proposed to solve them.
1985	These people, in tm , can then be of assistance in convincing their colleagues in the library and in the larger university community of the need to make those changes.

1985	Page 28 When the self-study ends, the report of the committee is forwarded to the Southern Association for validation.
1985	But the expectation is that the fact-finding and discussions that have gone on during the study will provide the kind of perspective that can carry through into planning for the development of the library in the years that follow.
1985	Evaluation in a University Setting The self-study process has been designed to facilitate change, and the basic process takes into account many of the elements of the planned change model that have the potential to enhance its capacity to do so.
1985	But there is little research to support the contention that change has been influenced by the process, either in the university as a whole or in components of the institution like the library.
1985	To fully understand the potential impact of the process, it is necessary to go beyond the literature of accreditation to determine what researchers have found about the operation of related evaluation procedures.
1985	The examination of evaluation procedures in higher education and in other not-for-profit enterprises provides information about how evaluation influences change that can then be considered in light of the special character of the accreditation process.
1985	Information about a variety of evaluation techniques has found its way into the literature of higher education.

1985	Page 29 application of various forms of self-study.
1985	Generally, self-studies are evaluations of the institutions or portions of its program by committees made up of its faculty and staff.
1985	While the planned change model emphasizes group dynamics and group problem -solving by those who w ill be asked to implement change, self-studies tend to be more traditional studies using a variety of research techniques and culminating in a report.
1985	The use of self-studies in higher education is not limited to accreditation.
1985	In fact, it is the tool most often used to assess activities on campus.
1985	Paul Dressel (1976) and others have gone to great lengths to detail a variant called "institutional research," and he and his associates have done much to explain how this process can be used to adapt institutions to meet the changing times.
1985	In another treatment of self-studies outside of the accreditation process, the State University of New York (1979) has developed a handbook of self-assessment procedures outlining methodologies that have been used to examine various portions of university programs.
1985	Using a series of cases relating to self-studies conducted on SUNY campuses, this monograph shows how effective self-assessm ent can be.
1985	While many of the studies were based on work in progress at the time the book was prepared, there is clear evidence of the effectiveness of self-assessm ent as a change agent.

1985	Page 30 self-studies adds a sobering note.
1985	Ladd examined studies not related to the accreditation process conducted on eleven campuses during the 1960's.
1985	While he found that change did result in some instances, he concluded that such change is unlikely unless prior to the start of the study a significant proportion of the faculty has accepted the fact that change is necessary or unless significant pressure for change is exerted by from agencies outside the institution.
1985	He holds that the main function of the self-study process is to package innovations that have wide support on campus in such a way that they can be accepted by those in authority, a concept that is closely akin to Dill and Friedman's (1979) conflict model.
1985	Kells and the Self-study Process H.R.
1985	Kells (1980) has produced what is perhaps the best single guide to the application of the self-study process to higher education.
1985	His book, Self-study Processes: a Guide for Post-secondary Institutions, is designed to assist in all kinds of self-assessm ents.
1985	While Kells focuses on accreditation, his aim is to develop a plan of action for integrating a variety of self-studies into an ongoing planning process.
1985	Kells believes that the success of the self-study depends on the support given to it by the chief administrative officer and other senior adm inistrators of the in stitu tio n .
1985	He also contends that the most effective studies are those that are conducted with Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.
1985	Further reproduction prohibited without permission.
1985	Page 31 Institutional goals in mind.
1985	Kells holds that, if a good analysis of the institution is done, the report that is forwarded to the outside agency will be a mere formality at the end of the study.
1985	An earlier Kells and Kirkwood (1978) study supports this contention.
1985	That study found that required responses to outside agencies tended to take care of themselves if the self-study committee believed that the prosecution of the study was important to the internal workings of the university.
1985	(Contrast this to Ashworth's (1979) position discussed on page 17 above.)
1985	Kells contends that, to be effective, the self-study effort must be well planned and must have a clear sense of what it is expected to produce.
1985	He supports the kind of broad participation in the process outlined by Havelock in the planned change model and encouraged by the Southern Association.
1985	His book is a step by step analysis of the process that is required to 'unfreeze' the organization so that it might look objectively at its problems and to develop a consensus about solutions to those problems.
1985	Kells stresses the importance of the readiness of the staff to participate in a self-study.
1985	Are staff members in the organization up to the intellectual and emotional rigors of this kind of process?
1985	If institutional morale is low or if the study comes at the end of a period of emotional upset, an impact can be fe lt on the self-study process.

1985	Page 32 Kells also contends that it is best to identify other factors that can have an impact on the self-study prior to the beginning of the study.
1985	The identification of historical and political situations that influence the study allows the self-study team to compensate for any biases they might introduce into the process.
1985	Finally, it is necessary in his view to round out the picture that is being drawn of the environment of the institution by assessing relationships in the university to determine how those might have an impact on the study.
1985	Like Havelock, Kells stresses the importance of individual relationships on any process that is likely to change an organization.
1985	Kells' book is a blueprint outlining in detail the application of a useful self-study process.
1985	Throughout his manual, he stresses the need for a study that is well organized and planned and that has clear objectives.
1985	Kells envisions a study that is based on broad participation and that speaks to political considerations in the organization.
1985	He has applied many of the premises underlying Havelock's (1972) planned change model and developed what may be the most useful framework now available for the development of a politically effective self-study process.

1985	Self-evalua tion and the Library Management Review and Analysis Program Self-evaluation has also become a fixture in academic libraries.
1985	The latest evidence of this is the development of the Management Review and Analysis Program (MRAP) by the Office of Management Studies of the Association of Research Libraries.
1985	According to Michael Buckland (1976), this program was designed to help individual libraries examine their management programs through a highly structured self-evaluation.
1985	MRAP was expected to increase the degree to which members of the library staff participate in the decision-making processes of the library and to increase the degree to which employees relate to library goals.
1985	Grady Morein (1979) says that the self-evaluation process was chosen for this project because it was assumed that the library staff is in the best position to identify needed changes in the program and that the inclusion of staff in the self-study willallow them to learn to use group decision-making processes.
1985	Duane Webster (1974) noted that the likelihood that changes w ill occur as a result of this process is dependent upon the readiness of the library staff to change, the support given to the implementation of MRAP by the library adm inistration, and the degree to which staff members are encouraged to involve themselves in the evaluation process.

1985	On the average, sixty percent of the recommendations generated by MRAP were implemented but the range of percentages of implementation have varied widely.
1985	They went from a high of ninety per cent to a low of ten per cent.
1985	The study found that staff members in institutions that participated in the program generally had a positive impression of MRAP's capacity to encourage change.
1985	The authors thought that the staffs were more accepting of innovation after the evaluation than before.
1985	However, the researchers also found that the overall perception of the value of the program varied widely within individual libraries and between libraries.
1985	In general, they concluded that the success of the program rested on the same issues identified by Webster, Morein, and others.
1985	The authors also noted that much of the difficulty with the application of MRAP stemmed from differences in perception among library staff members as to what the library's goals and purpose were, what role they were expected to play in the organization and the purpose of the evaluation.
1985	This goal confusion led to much d is s a tis f a c tio n .
1985	Johnson, Mann, and Whiting emphasized the need for increased preparation before using a process of this kind and a need for increased involvement of library directors and middle managers in future MRAP studies.

1985	Surveys .
1985	.
1985	One other major study has been conducted relating evaluation to the process of change in academic libraries.
1985	In 1958, Ernst Erikson completed a study of the results of twenty library surveys conducted with the help of outside consultants between 1938 and 1952.
1985	These surveys consisted of thorough appraisals of library operations done with the help of experts.
1985	Each concluded with a series of recommendations just as do accreditation or other self-study reports.
1985	Erikson found that over seventy-two per cent of the recommendations generated in the course of these studies were implemented and that many of the changes that were made during the course of the surveys could be linked directly to them.
1985	In those cases in which the recommendations were not implemented, the failures generally related to a lack of funds, personality problems, institutional restrictions, a general resistance to change in the library, or an unwillingness to accept the validity of the recommendations on the part of the library director or the library staff.

1985	However, these evaluative tools have been used to assess the quality of library programs and offer insights into how the evaluative process affects academic libraries.
1985	It is significant that the findings of impact studies relating to these other techniques are in general agreement with the studies of the impact of accreditation and reinforce their conclusions as to what elements are required to insure htat the process produces an atmosphere more conducive to change.
1985	Evaluation in Human Services Delivery Before ending consideration of evaluation processes, it is im portant to look a t evaluation procedures in human service delivery organizations.
1985	Because of requirements placed on them by federal and state agencies, social service organizations have developed sophisticated program evaluation techniques.
1985	Since the 1960's a substantial literature has emerged in this area.
1985	But even here, impact studies have been few, and the bulk of the evidence presented has been in the form of case studies.
1985	Howard R. Davis and Susan E. Salasin (1975) did conclude, however, that those evaluations that most often brought about change were the ones that took into account the political realities of the organization.
1985	Peter Rossi, Howard Freeman and Sonia Wright (1979) contend that the primary use of evaluation is as a political lever.

1985	They concluded that evaluation can be particularly useful in cases where there is a clearly demonstrated need for change and where recommendations conform to the goals and values of the audience to whom the report is addressed.
1985	They also contend that those issues most effectively addressed are the ones where technical advice provides specific information on clearly defined problems or those for which a better solution is offered to replace something that has clearly failed.
1985	Preevalua tion; Wholey1s Concept The literature relating to program evaluation has many of the same characteristics as that relating to the self-study process in higher education.
1985	However, it treats one area that is almost entirely missing from this literature.
1985	The concept of 'evaluability' has grown out of a concern that organizations do not always make the best use of evaluations.
1985	Students of the field have begun to look closely at this failure, and Howard Davis and Susan Salasin (1975), Joseph Wholey (1979), and others have come to the conclusion that not all organizations are equally able to benefit from such programs.
1985	Wholey contends that the organization must be willing to accept the concept of Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

1985	Page 38 evaluation for it to be helpful.
1985	Therefore, he proposes that a preevaluation should be conducted as part of the preparation for an evaluation.
1985	He feels that this is the only way that organizations can identify and deal with factors that might make the evaluation less effective.
1985	During this preevaluation, he suggests that the evaluator should determine how amenable the organization is to the process, how well defined its goals and objectives are, how plausible those objectives are in relation to the actual program and how well management has considered the potential usefulness of the study results.
1985	To get this inform ation, Wholey suggests the following program: 1.
1985	Define the program to be evaluated.
1985	2.
1985	Collect information on the intended project.
1985	3.
1985	Develop a concise description of the program.
1985	4.
1985	Determine the extent to which the library program is documented in measurable terms.
1985	5.
1985	Collect information on program reality.
1985	6.
1985	Synthesize all of the information that is acquired about the organization into a more inclusive description of its operation.
1985	7.
1985	Identify options for evaluation.
1985	8.
1985	Present the results to the administrator who must authorize the evaluation.
1985	This kind of preexamination can determine what kind of obstacles the organization presents to the evaluator.
1985	Wholey contends that if one is willing to use this procedure prior to an Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.
1985	Further reproduction prohibited without permission.
1985	Page 39 evaluation, many of these obstacles can either be eliminated prior to its inception or can be addressed early in the self-study process.
1985	Preevaluation speaks precisely to the needs expressed by Johnson, Mann, and W hiting (1977) fo r b e tte r preparation for MRAP studies and for support from a ll levels of adm inistration for the process.
1985	I t also indicates other preconditions for success for a ll self-studies.
1985	There is one problem for librarians in the application of Wholey's concept.
1985	This methodology has a strong prejudice for programs in which there is a paper trail of activities and discounts the value of any evaluation of programs without clear goals whose progress cannot be quantified.
1985	Its reliance on statistical information is helpful in technical services, but it is less applicable in those areas giving direct service to the public.
1985	Even so, it does offer one option for the administrator who is trying to prepare the organization for evaluation.
1985	AVIGTORY Another approach to the idea of evaluability has been developed by Howard Davis and Susan Salasin (1975).
1985	They dubbed their technique AVICTORY using an acronym derived from the eight basic characteristics they believe to be necessary for a successful evaluation.
1985	These are the Ability of the organization to carry out an evaluation; the Values of the organization as they relate to change; the Information available to support an Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

1985	Page 40 evaluation process; the Circumstances surrounding the organization that might relate to its capacity to accept criticism; the Timing of the proposed evaluation; the Obligation felt by members of the organization to find out how they are doing; the Resistance to evaluation in the organization; and the anticipated Yield of the process.
1985	Davis and Salasin developed a questionnaire based on these factors to test the readiness of an organization for evaluation.
1985	Their technique has some advantages over Wholey1s in that it relies less heavily on statistical data, but the questionnaire provides only a general overview of the situation in the organization.
1985	S till, AVIGTORY provides a solid alternative for engaging in a preevaluation.
1985	Sharon Studer and Preevaluation Sharon Studer (1980) asks managers to consider several other factors before deciding whether an evaluation will be of use to the organization.
1985	First, she stresses the personal factor in evaluation.
1985	Evaluations are most successful when there is a commitment on the part of management to the process being used to make the assessment.
1985	Success also requires an agreement prior to the beginning of the process as to how the results are to be reported and how they are expected to be used.
1985	Studer also contends that there should be a clear understanding about the kind of results that should be expected from the process.
1985	Finally, the author argues that the organization must expect that Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.
1985	Further reproduction prohibited without permission.
1985	Page 41 the benefits to be gained from the process will justify its anticipated cost.
1985	If all of these conditions are met at the beginning of a program evaluation, Studer feels that it is more likely to induce change.
1985	The preevaluation tools offer another component in the development of an effective evaluation process.
1985	They give the evaluator a tool to determine at the beginning of the process which of the elements of the diffusion and complex organization models might impact on the process and the values operating in the library that might affect the capacity of the organization to accept change.
1985	This kind of analysis gives that person the information needed to develop an appropriate evaluation tool for use in the organization.
1985	A ccreditation, Evaluation, and Change The difficulty in studying the impact of any evaluation process is that applications of the process should be tailored to meet the specific needs of the organization under study.
1985	As a result, evaluation studies tend to be highly personalized processes that are difficult to view in general terms.
1985	The literature of accreditation reflects this problem.
1985	No real consensus emerges as to its impact on institutions.
1985	By broadening the literature review, it is possible to identify some of the characteristics of the evaluation process and of the organization and communications patterns in the library that can Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.
1985	Further reproduction prohibited without permission.
1985	Page 42 be expected to influence the capacity of evaluation tx> encourage change.
1985	To go further, it is necessary to assim ilate this information into a paradigm against which specific applications of the accreditation process can be viewed.
1985	Even so, one must understand that consideration needs to be given to the special conditions accreditation encounters in individual institutions.
1985	Several important elements emerge from this survey of the literature.
1985	The first is that accreditation is a tool to be used for assuring funding and for promoting change.
1985	Change can occur as a result of accreditation, but there is no assurance that it necessarily will.
1985	Second, the personal relationships represented in the informal structure affect the capacity of the organization to accept and use suggestions for change.
1985	In particular, the support of managers is required for the process to have an effect.
1985	An appropriate preplanning process is required to determine how this informal structure will eventually affect the use of the results of accreditation.
1985	Third, the process used to study the institution is likely to determine the impact it will have.
1985	The more open the process is andthe broader the participation in it, the more likely it is to enhance the capacity of the library to change.
1985	Fourth, accreditation or any other evaluation process will have more of an impact if the issues it treats reflect the values of theuniversity and the expectations of those within the library organization.
1985	Fifth, Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.
1985	Further reproduction prohibited without permission.
1985	Page 43 and finally, accreditation should be viewed as both a process for gathering information and a mechanism for persuading both managers and others in the academic community of the need for a proposed change.
1985	It is a political process that should be used to see how well a change might be accepted and to build a constituency for a specific proposal.
1985	The literature provides much information about what the accreditation process is supposed to accomplish and how this is to be done.
1985	To go further, it is necessary to assim ilate this information into a model against which specific applications of the accreditation process can be viewed.
1985	This will be done in Chapter 2.

1988	On the other hand, paper conservator Marilyn Kemp Weidner, commenting on the paucity of research and investigation devoted to works of art on paper concluded: What we are able to learn comes mainly from those working on libraryandarchivalmaterials.
1988	Butsolutionsforthetreatmentof this type of material, which is usually printed in fairly insoluble ink, must be adapted by the fine arts conservator because of the possibility of the solubility of the artists' media and the need for concern to preserve the surface appearance of the work of art.
1988	Also, in handling the large masses of library material, the need for speed is often a major consideration, whereas, with works of art, a slow, more tedious method is sometimes considered a safer solution.
1988	Weidner's observations were made in 1967, almost a hundred years afterthebeginningoftheperiodexaminedinthisstudy.
1988	Perhapsshe had been affected by the work of that group of British book binders and conservators who influenced librarians and art conservators alike 367   duringthenineteensixtiesandseventies.
1988	MensuchasPeterWaters, Christopher Clarkson, Don Etherington, Roger Powell, and Sydney Cockerel1, book binders and conservators with common experiences at London's Royal College of Art and other British schools, as well as in Florence after the flood, visited this country during that period, speaking,teachingbookbinding,andsharingtheirexpertise.
1988	Peter Waters, Christopher Clarkson, and Don Etherington took up American residence and assumed positions in the Preservation Office of the Library of Congress, helping develop and improve its preservation program.
1988	Thewritingsandresearchoftheothers(Powellwasthe conservator of the Book of Kells) influenced conservators of books and worksofartonpaperalike.
1988	Itislikelythatthesemen,inturn,may have learned much of their craft and technique from persons working in thefieldofart.
1988	Iftheconservatorsoflibraryandarchival materials appear to be in a position of leadership at the present, perhaps at points in the past the work of those caring for works of art onpaperwasinstructivetolibrarians.
1988	Ascendancyhasprobably seesawed between the two groups over a long period, each taking whatever it could make use of from the technique or research of the other.
1988	In Sum There was some transference of preservation technique for special materials (rare books, documents, manuscripts, and works of art on paper) to mainstream library materials.
1988	Many methods employed with general library volumes (removing stains from papers and bindings, 368   mending tears, dressing leathers) seem to have derived from practices associated with rare books.
1988	Any relationship between procedures commonly used with documents andmanuscripts(silking,tissuing)ismuchlessclear.
1988	Themajor contribution of document-related research to the preservation of general library materials was the standard for book cloths developed by theU.S.BureauofStandards.
1988	TheworkoftheU.S.LeatherandPaper Laboratory on the permanence and durability of papers also influenced librarians' thinking.
1988	The turn of the century was a time of experimentation in methods formanuscriptpreservation.
1988	Someofthecleaningandrepair techniques used with book papers may have derived from similar treatmentsformanuscripts,probablyviararebooks.
1988	Whilethereisno evidence that any of the protective baths used with manuscripts were ever applied to general library materials, the use of photographic techniques as a technique for manuscript preservation would eventually have a major influence on mainstream monographs and periodicals.
1988	Library books and works of art on paper, produced for different purposes and unlike in format and medium, consequently received differentpreservationtreatments.
1988	Becauseoftheircommonpaperbase, there was some exchange of cleaning, repair, and other preservation techniques, although it cannot be demonstrated that librarians borrowed their preservation approaches from methods for drawings and prints.
1988	Since neither library nor museum conservation was a well-developed or documented discipline at the turn of the century, it seems likely that neither librarians nor the cleaners of prints and drawings held ascendancy.
1988	369   The value and uniqueness of rare books, manuscripts, and works of art on paper, along with the historic significance of government documents, contributed to the development of a preservation mission whichcarriedovertomoregenerallibrarymaterials.
1988	Atthesame time, the singular nature of these special material types also inspired a preservation ethic cautious in the application of new techniques and conscious of the item's value as an artifact.

1988	375   CHAPTER XVI 1910: LOOKINGBACKWARD,LOOKINGFORWARD Introduction The study's final chapter examines the hypotheses and questions introduced in Chapter 1 and reviews milestones in preservation history thathaveoccurredsince1910.
1988	Italsoexploresthecircumstances which might have caused preservation to move from a state of grass-roots activity at the turn of the century, to that of a national movement in the late twentieth century.
1988	1876-1910: TheExistenceofPreservationActivity The validity of the first of this study's two hypotheses�that, from 1876 forward, some level of preservation practice can be documentedinAmericanlibraries--hasalreadybeendemonstrated.
1988	In fact, the degree of concern and the level of activity may be surprising, with both the reports of library administrators and the contents of the professional press charged with expressions of alarm about poorly made, deteriorating collections; dismay over buildings vulnerable to fire; and counsel on cleaning, mending, and binding materials.
1988	Asimpleexaminationofthetransitionsininterestwhich occurred during the period serves to underscore the consistent existence of preservation activity, as well as to answer the first of the eight questions (did shifts in preservation interest or emphasis occurduringtheperiodofthestudy?)posedinChapter1.
1988	Certainly, 376   many preservation concerns persisted throughout the thirty-five years (and s till exist today); yet, at various times some were more prominent than others.
1988	During the early years of the period covered by this study, librarians' preservation interests, as expressed in their reports and library literature, were largely confined to sound custodial and fire prevention measures, the qualities of various binding materials, binding techniques, and various library devices (shelving, book supports, book covers, pamphlet binders and boxes).
1988	Carnegie's g ifts and the planning for the new Library of Congress gave importance to library architecture; the relationship of building design to preservation was another popular topic throughout the 1880's.
1988	Between 1876 and 1890 there was also considerable concern about the leather decay popularly attributed to gas lighting.
1988	A study of the causes of leather deterioration was first proposed in 1877, at the Conference of Librarians, London.
1988	However, electric lighting (introduced in American libraries in the early 1880's) and the increased use of book cloths (first manufactured in the United States in 1883) made the issue less pressing.
1988	By the time the Royal Society of Arts completed its report on leathers for bookbinding (1901), American interest in the topic had lessened.
1988	I t seems fa ir to say that the transitions from gas to electrical lighting, and from leather to book cloths, permitted the shift of interest from the analysis of the by-products of illuminating gas to the inferior publishers' bindings which were to characterize the 1890's and the first decade of the new century.
1988	377   In the 1890's, librarians began openly protesting the poor construction and flimsiness of publishers' bindings; their complaints were the result of a steady increase in the mechanization of edition binding.
1988	Early in the new century, the idea of special, sturdier library editions emerged; the firs t examples were published in 1907 (although their level of acceptance never corresponded with the degree of publicity they were given).
1988	During the same decade, the last of this study, American librarians became interested in the quality of book papers.
1988	Although the Prussian Regulations had been acquired for study by the Librarian of Congress in 1896 and the Society of Arts' Committee on Paper Deterioration published its report in 1898, not until the U. S. Leather and Paper Laboratory began its work on book papers (1904-1909, and well-publicized in Library Journal) did this issue capture the attention of American librarians.
1988	Standards for book cloths and publishers' edition bindings were also largely products of this decade.
1988	Dana's binding exhibit and the appointment of A. L.
1988	A.
1988	's Committee on Bookbinding (1905) exemplify librarians' early twentieth century interest in the qualities of publishers' bindings, book papers, and standards for binding and binding materials.
1988	Over the course of the th irty -fiv e years of the study, American preservation interests became both more sophisticated and more cooperative.
1988	Changes in technology and materials (gas to electric lighting; leather to book cloths) addressed the major problem perceived in the firs t part of the period.
1988	In the second part, librarians organized themselves to seek better quality publishers' bindings and book papers and, if not themselves to conduct relevant research, at least to follow and publicize that conducted by others.
1988	The St. Gall 378   Conference, in itia te d to address conservation problems associated with manuscripts and rare materials, was organized by a librarian; its membership was largely librarians, and it represents the first instance 1 This study's second hypothesis, that the greater part of the period's research and a c tiv ity focused on external preservation approaches, rather than the problems inherent in the materials of which books are made, is also substantiated.
1988	Librarians wrote at length about the several environmental causes of decay (dust, damp, heat, light, air pollution), the need for fireproof construction, a variety of preservation-related appliances, and the proper handling of library materials, both by staff and readers.
1988	They fille d the pages of their institutions' annual reports with information about every imaginable aspect of binding and repair, including materials, costs, and techniques, and railed against cheap, short-lived publishers' bindings, demanding the development of a different, stronger type of book suitable for libraries.
1988	This is not to say that librarians were unconcerned about deteriorating bindings and book papers, but rather that they devoted less energy to these topics (as the pages of this study show) and, when they did address them, only infrequently did so in terms of "inherent vice."
1988	The Royal Society of Arts' 1901 report blamed tanning and dyeing residues for subsequent leather decay, and the U. S. Leather and of collective international concern for deteriorating m aterials.
1988	stage was set for the considerable research and cooperation to come in the next decades.
1988	External Preservation Approaches Versus Internal Problems The 379   Paper Laboratory wrote about the destructiveness of chemical remnants in book papers.
1988	A number of librarians, however, continued incorrectly to ascribe the decay they decried to external factors, such as gas lighting.
1988	More typical than the work of the Leather and Paper Laboratory and the Royal Society of Arts were articles like Rossiter Johnson's "Inferior Paper a Menace to the Permanency of Literature" and Frank H ill's "The Deterioration of Newspaper Paper," which simply did not address cause.
1988	Johnson worried about the disintegration of modern book papers, but displayed no understanding of the origins of deterioration.
1988	H ill deplored the loss of valuable historical records represented by newspapers, but also expressed no sense of the determinants of the disintegration.
1988	Perhaps librarians chose to concentrate on external matters (the building, book stacks and book supports, book construction) because these were easily grasped and fu lly understood: while paper deterioration was a problem whose solution was basic to the success of a ll other preservation techniques, its enormity and mystery may have combined to confound librarians, leading them to address topics whose dimensions they could more easily comprehend.
1988	The Influence of Disasters on Preservation Activity The second question posed in Chapter 1 of this study asks whether disasters promoted preservation a c tiv ity .
1988	The disasters which occurred during the period between 1876 and 1910 were limited to fires; there were no recorded floods.
1988	Certainly the frame buildings occupied by many libraries, coupled with a fair amount of open-flame lighting and 380   heating, made disasters more common then than now.
1988	While those which resulted in the destruction of large, significant collections were widely publicized and heightened the preservation consciousness, none of these unfortunate but rather commonplace events sparked international or even national work in the way the Florence flood would, three-quarters of a century later, when such calamities were less expected and more electrifying.
1988	Nonetheless, each blaze, whether at home or abroad, whether publicized in the professional press or simply recorded in an internal library document, prompted some sort of preservation-related activity, even i f i t was only urging upon others the necessity for precaution.
1988	As might be expected, many fires were followed by experimentation with various drying and mending techniques.
1988	The best publicized fires were those of the Free Public Library of Birmingham, England, the National Library of Turin, the Philadelphia Mercantile Library, and the San Francisco Public Library.
1988	Following the Birmingham fire an article in Library Journal suggested that such calamities should make American librarians more vigilant against fire in their own institutions.
1988	The author of another Library Journal piece on fire prevention said his writing was inspired by the Birmingham blaze.
1988	The event also prompted the Boston Public Library to employ a night watchman.
1988	Likewise, the fire which destroyed the San Francisco Public Library in 1906 led to articles in the library press on the features necessary to fireproof architecture.
1988	More material examples of activity resulted from the fires at Turin and Philadelphia.
1988	While the Turin fire led to no discernible preservation action in U. S. lib ra rie s , Library Journal reported the 381   survey of safety conditions in government libraries which the Italian government conducted as a result of this conflagration.
1988	Further, a piece in this popular periodical suggested that the Turin fire indicated a need to develop photographic reproduction methods for valuable library materials.
1988	In Ita ly , new methods of treating burnt, water-soaked books were developed and documented following the Turin fire.
1988	Similarly, the Philadelphia Mercantile Library experimented with a variety of book-drying techniques following its 1877 fire.
1988	These approaches, as well as information about fire prevention methods for libraries, were subsequently published in Library Journal.
1988	The techniques used to dry and repair the volumes damaged in the Trinity College fire, 1907, were documented both in the annual report of its librarian and in Library Journal.
1988	In the Milwaukee Public Library's Annual Report of the Board of Trustees.
1988	1894-1895 appeared descriptions of the drying techniques tried at this institution following its 1894 blaze.
1988	These experiments in repair and restoration were the most tangible examples of post-disaster preservation a c tiv ity .
1988	Changes in Nineteenth Century Paper and Binding Technology This study also seeks to determine whether changes in nineteenth century paper and binding technology influenced preservation interest and a c tiv ity .
1988	Arguably, such changes were more instrumental in creating and sustaining interest and activity than were any other factors.
1988	Early in this study's thirty-five year span, librarians responded most strongly to the deterioration of leather bindings; by 1890, however, the increased availability and use of book cloths, 382   coupled with the introduction of electric lighting, lessened this concern.
1988	As the public's demand for reasonably priced books grew, publishers moved rapidly from partial to complete mechanization of the binding process.
1988	This same period was one of great collection growth for libraries, whose managers soon found their shelves fillin g with volumes machine-sewn with cheap thread, insecurely attached to boards covered with inferior, quick-to-wear cloths.
1988	This call for quantities of inexpensive reading material also led to the development of faster methods of paper manufacture, and the introduction of cheaper materials.
1988	While it was not necessary that machine-made books be poorly made books (sewing machines were capable of sewing all along and onto tapes; quality threads and book cloths were available), most publishing houses aimed at producing volumes acceptable to the private citizen, not to libraries, which demanded much more permanence and durability from the publishers' product.
1988	Likewise, there were alternative paper production methods that, while making use of cheaper, more readily available materials, did not produce papers which shortly embrittled and broke from th e ir bindings.
1988	But again, then as today, manufacturers aimed their handiwork at the individual consumer, perceived to want a book for a finite period of time, rather than at libraries, which wished many volumes to last indefinitely.
1988	The anger engendered by the inferior products of new binding and paper technologies produced the American Library Association's firs t committee charged with a preservation-related mission.
1988	One might contend that librarians' well-publicized dissatisfaction with machine-made books printed on poor quality papers led in 1905 to the 383   establishment of A. L.
1988	A.
1988	's Committee on Bookbinding and Book Papers and the focus of the Committee's work on obtaining better standards for publishers' bindings, securing special library editions of certain titles, and publicizing and promoting the work of the U. S. Leather and Paper Laboratory.
1988	Even though librarians were not in agreement on precisely what they wanted from publishers (some wanted special library editions; others wanted better publishers' editions, at little or no additional cost), they were unanimous in their unhappiness with the contemporary publisher's product and looked for the firs t time to their professional organization for help with a preservation matter.
1988	No issue dominates the last ten years of this study as does the inferior nature of the modern book's construction.
1988	The Influence of Conservation Methods and Thinking for Rare Books.
1988	Documents.
1988	Manuscripts.
1988	And Works of Art on Paper Whether conservation methods for rare books, documents, manuscripts, and works of art on paper influenced methods for mainstream library materials has been addressed above, in Chapter 14.
1988	Most of the methods for mending and cleaning general library materials seem to have derived from procedures used with rare books.
1988	Conversely, there is l i t t l e or no evidence that techniques commonly used with documents and manuscripts (silking and tissuing; preservative baths) influenced measures used with books.
1988	There is one clear example of document-related preservation work influencing the American library community: the book cloth research of the U. S. Bureau of Standards was well known to librarians, who asked binders to provide fabrics for general library materials which met the 384   Bureau's Standards.
1988	Any direct influence of the investigations of the U. S. Leather and Paper Laboratory on the qualities of permanent and durable book papers is less clear, although A. L. A .
1988	's Committee on Bookbinding kept the Laboratory's research before the eyes of the library community and it was this body's work which helped create a broad awareness of the causes of paper deterioration.
1988	American librarians were also aware of German and Italian efforts to secure paper specifications for government records, and John Russell Young, Librarian of Congress, studied the Prussian Regulations for Supply and Examination of Paper, which preceded and may have influenced the work of the U. S. Leather and Paper Laboratory.
1988	Out of the desire to share and preserve at least the intellectual content of manuscripts grew techniques and plans for their photoreproduction.
1988	While Boston Public had a fa c ility where manuscripts and other material might be photocopied, this was a rarity in American libraries of the period, and none of the several schemes to systematically photograph manuscripts was actually implemented.
1988	Although there is no direct evidence that early efforts to photograph manuscript collections eventually led to the extension of this preservation technique to other library materials, it seems likely that this was the case.
1988	There is even less evidence that preservation techniques for works of art on paper influenced those used with library volumes.
1988	This is not too surprising, for although the two material types share a common paper base, their formats differ greatly, as do the media applied to or imprinted on their papers.
1988	Even though works of art on paper were subject to many of the same deteriorating influences (lig h t, 385   damp, heat, dust) that affected library materials, their uniqueness, coupled with the importance of their appearance, called for more cautious, meticulous preservation approaches, whereas the sheer quantity in which library materials were produced demanded swifter, less critical methods.
1988	These same differences also limited the sharing of cleaning and repair techniques, although there were clearly some sim ilarities in method and materials.
1988	While Vatican librarian Franz Ehrle spoke of techniques for manuscript preservation as deriving from those for works of art on paper, there is no compelling evidence from this period one way or the other, and it seems most likely that, over time, those caring for works of art on paper and those attempting to preserve library materials have learned from each other, one group leading at one time, the other at another.
1988	It is likely that the general library preservation ethic and mission developed from thinking about rare books, documents, manuscripts, and works of art on paper.
1988	From rare books came the importance of retaining the integrity of the book as artifact.
1988	Documents, whether federal, state, or local, were considered invaluable parts of history; from this perception the broader preservation mission may have evolved.
1988	Work with manuscripts and works of art on paper generated the idea of restraint in the application of preservation techniques; their uniqueness called for conservative methods, using proven materials, which may have carried over into approaches used with general library collections.
1988	386   The Influence of Preservation Methods And Research From Abroad Among the vehicles that made possible the international exchange of preservation research and technique were national library organizations, journals, monographs, and conferences.
1988	A country with a library'association and a library press had the means to share its thinking with other nations; at conferences with multinational memberships, librarians met and talked together.
1988	A common language and culture (such as that shared by the United States and Great Britain) facilitated the communication necessary for influence to occur.
1988	It is clear that preservation research and activity in Great Britain had considerable impact on American practice.
1988	Less certain is the effect that work in Germany, Belgium, the Vatican, and Italy may have had.
1988	The Library Association of the United Kingdom was organized in 1877, one year after the American Library Association.
1988	By 1900, a German library association, Verein deutscher Bibliothekare, and an Italian one, Societa Bibliographica Italiana, were both established and 2 holding regular conferences.
1988	British librarians quickly developed a liv e ly press, including such journals as Library World.
1988	The Library.
1988	Library Assistant.
1988	Library Chronicle, and several title s from the Library Association, including Monthly Notes.
1988	Transactions, and the Library Association Record: articles about preservation from these publications were often abstracted, summarized, or republished in American library periodicals.
1988	British figures active in library preservation, such as Cedric Chivers and Edward W. B. Nicholson, 3 published in Library Journal and other American journals.
1988	of British monographs were studied by American librarians, including Any number 387   those of Blades, Cockerel!, Coutts, Stephen, Zaehnsdorf, and the several publications of the Royal Society of Arts and the Library Association of the United Kingdom.
1988	German preservation news appeared from time to time in Library Journal (sometimes abstracted from Zentralblatt fur Bibliothekswesen and other German periodicals); included were articles about German-led attempts to produce manuscript facsimiles, and the cellulose bath Zapon, first employed in the preservation of library materials by the Saxon government.
1988	A paper by Dr. 0.
1988	Hartwig of the University Library at Halle was published in translation in Library Journal: i t was Hartwig who first proposed the photographic reproduction of 4 manuscripts.
1988	Two papers by Guido Biagi, director of the Biblioteca Mediceo-Laurenziana, Florence, appeared in Library Journal in 1904; one described the fire in the National Library of Turin on January 26 of that year, and the other addressed the reproduction of manuscripts by photography.
1988	A few months later, Library Journal provided references to two Italian periodicals that described document restoration measures 5 applied to materials which survived the Turin fire .
1988	Conferences were another means for sharing ideas.
1988	Representatives from seventeen American Libraries in eight states attended the Conference of Librarians, London, 1877.
1988	Among the attendees were Dewey, Cutter, Poole, and Winsor, who had the opportunity to hear Edward W. B. Nicholson lecture on book cloths, including the new fabric buckram, and other British librarians describe the damage to their collections which they attributed to illuminating gas.
1988	At the International Congress for the Reproduction of 388   Manuscripts, Liege, 1905, Charles M ills Gayley of the University of California improved his understanding of photographic techniques for preserving and sharing archival materials.
1988	The Chief of the Manuscript Division, Library of Congress, attended the International Congress of Archivists and Librarians, Brussels, August, 1910, where preservation 6 these foreign countries affect American thought and activity?
1988	While the archivists and librarians of Germany, Belgium, Ita ly , and the Vatican were influential in shaping American preservation practice for a variety of special materials, no nation except England shared research or work that related to the preservation of mainstream library materials.
1988	It is not surprising that older European nations, possessing large collections of unique and deteriorating manuscripts and documents, concentrated their preservation efforts in these areas.
1988	Work done in Germany and the Vatican in the preservation of manuscripts and documents was significant; Belgian librarians were an important force in the photoreproduction of manuscripts, and Italy's fire at Turin in 1904 led to the development of document repair techniques which were communicated to American librarians.
1988	British contributions to American preservation practice for general library materials were significant and deserve to be summarized.
1988	During the period addressed by this study, well-developed public library systems and substantial academic and research libraries existed both in the United States and England; it is logical that the two countries developed preservation concerns for contemporary materials.
1988	Rich cultural correspondences and well-developed was a topic.
1988	How did access to the preservation literature and experience of 389   professional library organizations and publications made sharing research and ideas a simple step.
1988	I t may be that some of the most basic tenets and techniques of American library preservation have British roots (the importance of preserving local materials; fundamental repair and binding techniques); but in considering "influence" this study lim its its e lf to clear examples of the transfer of knowledge from one country to another.
1988	Books like Blades' The Enemies of Books may have contributed to a general American preservation consciousness, and the binding manuals of Cockerel1, Stephen and Coutts, and Zaehnsdorf prescribed American handbinding technique.^ English book cloths covered American volumes for many years, before New England factories began to manufacture such O products.
1988	binding; his services were used by many American librarians, and American binders attempted to emulate the strength of his bindings.
1988	The work of every U. S. binder was inevitably compared, either Q favorably or unfavorably, to Chivers'.
1988	The fire at the Birmingham, England, public library produced a rash of writings in American library journals urging fireproof construction and various fire prevention techniques.
1988	*� I t was the British who pioneered research in protective colored window glass, although no American response is readily perceivable.
1988	However, the Library of Congress responded to the Society of Arts' conclusions about the injurious nature of sunlight by installing a mechanical window blind system.
1988	** British libraries led the way with electric lighting.
1988	*^ Cedric Chivers was an undisputed genius in library 390   The Society of Arts' report on the causes of deterioration in binding leathers (which concluded that modern tanning methods were responsible for most of the faults in modern leathers) was covered completely in the American library press, and some librarians began to ask their binders to supply them with leathers which met the Society's standards.
1988	The research conducted by the LAUK's Sound Leather Committee (which underscored the damaging nature of contemporary tanning techniques) was also available to American librarians and 13 predated the major work of the U.S. Leather and Paper Laboratory.
1988	The British also introduced research into the causes of paper deterioration.
1988	While the Society of Arts' 1898 report was slender and largely summarized certain German findings, i t identified the qualities in mechanical wood papers which led to their rapid deterioration and recommended against the addition of too many minerals or too much size.
1988	It preceded any American work and was anticipated in the pages of Library Journal.
1988	Cedric Chivers' research was also followed by American librarians, although i t is d iffic u lt to compare i t with that of the U.S. Leather and Paper Laboratory, which was underway at about 14 the same time.
1988	The British also led in the development of binding specifications.
1988	Those set forth by the Society of Arts in the report o f i t s Committee on Leather fo r Bookbinding preceded the standards o f ALA's Committee on Bookbinding (and Stephen's enhancement thereof); included in Cockerell's popular binding manual Bookbinding and the Care 15 of Books, they were certain to be employed in American libraries.
1988	391   Library Size and Mission The question of an underlying relationship between a library's size or sense of archival/research function and its interest in preservation is an interesting one.
1988	Clearly, most large libraries (particularly those of sizable universities and cities) perceived themselves as having an archival or research mission; the in a b ility to judge which materials future scholars might need imposed a responsibility to preserve the complete collections.
1988	Among the libraries which underscored this obligation to safeguard their materials for the use of generations to come were those of Yale, Cornell, and Harvard universities; the cities of Boston, Buffalo, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Detroit, and St. Louis; and the Library of Congress.
1988	Nevertheless, many much smaller institutions also described their responsibility to keep their materials safe for the scholars of the future.
1988	Such libraries included those of Bangor, Brookline (Massachusetts), New Bedford (Massachusetts), Paterson (New Jersey), and Wilmington; the Boston Athenaeum; Amherst College; and the state of Iowa.
1988	Dozens of other libraries both large (Brooklyn Public, Milwaukee Public, Columbia College, New York State) and small (Bowdoin College, and the public libraries of East Orange, Burlington, and Lawrence) exhibited a strong preservation interest, whether in mending, binding, shelf maintenance, or other areas of activity.
1988	It seems fair to say that, while most large university and public libraries fe lt a distinct preservation mission and displayed an accompanying interest in preservation work, this sense of mission and show of interest was not 392   confined to large libraries.
1988	Many smaller institutions also perceived themselves as having a preservation responsibility and consequently involved themselves in a variety of preservation concerns and activities.
1988	The Role of the Library Administrator In several instances there appears to have been a direct relationship between the level of preservation activity in a given library, and the specific professional interests of that institution's chief administrator.
1988	For example, the Wilmington Institute, Worcester County Law Library, and Washington D. C. Public Library, managed, respectively, by Arthur L. Bailey, George E. Wire, and George F. Bowerman of A. L.
1988	A.
1988	's Committee on Bookbinding, were leaders in research and experimentation with binding materials and techniques.
1988	Similarly, F. J. Soldan, director of the Peoria Public Library, had a special professional interest in binding which was reflected in his institution's development of binding standards.
1988	More common, perhaps, was the institution managed by one (or a succession) of the period's major library figures, under whose leadership i t engaged in considerable preservation thinking and activity.
1988	Such leaders and their institutions included John C. Dana, director at Springfield and Newark; Melvil Dewey, Columbia and the New York State Library; Justin Winsor, Boston Public and Harvard; Charles A. Cutter, the Boston Athenaeum; Frederick Crunden, St. Louis Public; William I .
1988	Fletcher, the Silas Bronson Library and Amherst College; Frank P. H ill, Paterson Free Library, Salem Public Library, Newark Free Public Library, and Brooklyn Public Library; Henry J. Carr, Grand 393   Rapids Public Library, St. Joseph Free Public Library, and Scranton Public Library; Herbert J. Putnam, Minneapolis Public Library, Boston Public Library, and the Library of Congress; and H. M. Utley, the public libraries of Detroit and Jacksonville.
1988	It would be risky, except with the members of the bookbinding committee and perhaps Dana and Dewey, to assume that these librarians' individual professional interests led to the preservation concern and action observable in the institutions they managed.
1988	In the case where several smaller collections were successively administered by a single leader (such as Dana, Fletcher, H ill, or Carr), this is likely true.
1988	In considering larger university and city libraries, it may well be that the size and mission of the library its e lf, rather than the personal interests of its chief administrator, were responsible for the organization's preservation efforts.
1988	The Effect of Budget on Preservation Activity The availability of funding did indeed affect a library's level and quality of preservation activity.
1988	While any library could keep its facility clean and encourage staff and readers to handle materials with care, almost all other preservation measures cost money.
1988	Even the largest libraries cut corners when dollars were short.
1988	Economies ranged from the gross (conserving fuel by not heating stack areas, as did the Redwood) to those less immediately obvious (buying a cheaper grade of binding cloth).
1988	There appears to have been no library with resources adequate to i t s every preservation need.
1988	Areas of economy could be roughly divided among those affecting the library fa c ility , labor, or collection maintenance.
1988	Those 394   involving the building included the employ of gas light rather than electricity, the use of unsuitably prepared shelving space (basements), and the absence of adequate fire precautions.
1988	While most new buildings were built along fireproof principles, many libraries lacked the funding necessary to take adequate preventive measures in older, existing structures.
1988	In some cases, such as that of the Public Library of Bangor, the result was the destruction of the entire library.
1988	Some libraries were unable to employ enough janitors, dusters, or menders to maintain their collections properly.
1988	Many institutions lacked an adequate binding fund, a shortage which was particularly detrimental to the preservation mission.
1988	Often, such libraries mended extensively, ultimately ruining many of their volumes.
1988	The use of cheaper, less durable materials and poorer quality sewing also contributed to the deterioration of collections.
1988	Some libraries with insufficient binding funds allowed materials to continue to circulate until they completely fe ll apart.
1988	Others withdrew such title s and held them aside, until binding money became available.
1988	S till others rebound injured volumes by diverting money available for the purchase of new books for the collections.
1988	Those libraries which had no funds to bind periodicals, newspapers, or pamphlets sometimes bundled these materials and tied them in groups, a practice which resulted in loss and serious damage.
1988	Libraries often attempted to stretch their book budgets further by purchasing books in publishers' bindings, rather than paying the extra few cents per title for a copy bound from the sheets, or a special library edition.
1988	It would be incorrect to say that large libraries, such as the Boston Public Library, were better able to fund their preservation 395   activities than were smaller ones.
1988	Boston's annual reports show years of shortages of binding revenue.
1988	Indeed, the Newark Free Public Library or the libraries of Wilmington or Washington, D.C., administered by managers with great interests in preservation issues, were arguably better budgeted for binding, which was this period's chief preservation approach.
1988	Looking Toward the Future There were a number of intriguing ideas about the preservation possibilities the future might bring.
1988	Perhaps a method of fireproofing book papers would be discovered.
1988	*� The use of yet-to-be-developed photoreproduction processes seemed the only hope for preserving badly deteriorated materials--in effect, this would create an image of unique items which would freeze them forever in time: The application of photography and of photogravure to the reproduction of texts .

1988	By thus wonderfully forecasting the future these reproductions render less disastrous the effects of a fire such as that which lately destroyed the library of Turin.

1988	This, I think, would, nay, should, be the most serious principal duty assumed by the library of the future: to preserve these treasures of the past while hoping that the present and,the future may add to them new ones worthy of public veneration.
1988	"The twentieth century has the task of evoking method and order among rather than within libraries," predicted another librarian, whose "phantasy" included a nationwide system of regional "reservoir" libraries, each of which would collect and preserve in certain assigned lO areas.
1988	Charles A. Cutter, delivered in an address on the occasion of the More fascinating forecasts, however, came from the visionary 396   dedication of the new Buffalo Public Library building in 1883.
1988	Entitled "The Buffalo Public Library in 1983," Cutter's piece contemplated what library facilities and systems might be like, one hundred years in the future.
1988	He described a library building surrounded on three sides by "wide avenues" which "gave i t a ir and lig h t, and protected i t against fire ."
1988	The neighboring streets were kept clean, "to prevent, as far as might be, the evil of dust."
1988	"With electric illumination," Cutter continued, "we are both light and cool."
1988	The reading room was not heated above seventy degrees, and the 19 stacks were kept at sixty.
1988	Cutter, too, anticipated cooperative collecting and conservation; in 1983 only the newspapers of Buffalo and neighboring towns were retained, since "half a century before the preservation of newspapers had become one of the most perplexing problems of library economy."
1988	With regard to the library facility, "the passages are all covered with a noiseless and dustless covering," and rooms were low-ceilinged, to avoid the accumulation of "bad air."
1988	The old idea "of dipping books in the solution they use for actresses' dresses and scenery" had been abandoned in favor of constructing walls, floors, and shelving of 20 incombustible materials.
1988	techniques for preserving and sharing the intellectual content of library materials, Cutter predicted the creation of "fonografic [sic] 21 editions prepared by the best readers."
1988	To what extent were these visions of new, more effective preservation techniques and cooperation realized?
1988	Following World War I , preservation-related research began to increase.
1988	At the New York Public Library, since its beginnings interested in preservation Finally, instead of photographic 397   matters, Harry Lydenberg established a separate laboratory, where he conducted experiments in manual and mechanical methods of paper treatment; the results were published in 1931 in The Care and Repair of Books.
1988	In 1934, the National Bureau of Standards sponsored widely discussed studies of book papers, which attributed the deterioration of library materials chiefly to air pollution, inherently poor paper, ruinous humidity and heat, and over-exposure to light.
1988	A year later, the Minimum Standard Specifications for Class A Library Binding was published, and the founding of the Library Binding Institute enhanced 22 cooperation between librarians and library binders.
1988	While articles on specific aspects of preservation (binding, repair, care and cleaning) were common to library literature from its inception, for the firs t time more comprehensive pieces appeared, as the idea of a preservation element in a total library program began to 23 emerge.
1988	development of film as a preservation technique.
1988	Among the persons pioneering in reprography was Herman Fussier, whose Photographic Reproduction in Libraries became a classic.
1988	During this same period, Carolyn Horton joined the American Philosophical Society as the nation's first library conservator; as the decade ended, William Barrow began the research in various aspects of paper permanence and 24 durability which would flower in the 1950's.
1988	World War I I heightened preservation concerns.
1988	The index term "War and the Library," under which were found numerous articles recommending disaster plans and methods for treating burned books, 25 appeared in Library Literature.
1988	war, Pelham Barr published one of the most quoted articles in the Perhaps the most major contribution of the 1930's was the In the firs t year following the 398   collective literature of library preservation, "Book Conservation and University Library Administration."
1988	Here, he presented basic problems (deterioration, binding, wear and tear) and outlined a program for combatting them; the concept of preservation as a distinct functional 26 library element was further developed.
1988	Conservator Paul Banks has termed the period between the end of the second World War and the early 1960's "the silent years," because it offers so little evidence of preservation work and research.
1988	A quick examination of the pages of Library Literature shows this to be true.
1988	Nonetheless, there was some activity.
1988	The 1950's marked the beginning of foundation interest in library conservation as the Council on Library Resources (CLR), shortly after its founding, funded Barrow's research on the physical strength of paper (1957), then the Barrow Laboratory (1961), and the Library Technology Program (1960).
1988	The Association of Research Libraries appointed its Committee on Preservation of Research Library Materials in 1960.
1988	The severity of the paper deterioration problem and the threat it posed to the nation's library collections was documented when Gordon Williams' report The Preservation of Deteriorating Books: An Examination of the Problem With Recommendations for a Solution was published by the Association in 1964.
1988	Williams' research supported and further publicized Barrow's finding that ninety percent of a ll books printed in the United States between 1900 and 1949 would be virtually unusable by the year 2000; he proposed that a federally funded agency be formed to address the 27 problem.
1988	Over the next twenty years, research and other conservation activity continued apace.
1988	In 1965 the National Register of Microform 399   Masters appeared, aiding the preservation effort by listing titles and locations of microform master films from which service copies could be OQ made.
1988	library and general press, sensational.
1988	In addition to generating considerable publicity for conservation issues, these disasters also provided many opportunities 30 to test and develop new conservation techniques.
1988	In the year that followed the Florence flood, the Library of Congress began its CLR-funded Pilot Preservation Project.
1988	The Library soon identified a lis t of deteriorating title s within its collections and identified copies in better condition in other American libraries.
1988	In accordance with Williams' recommendations, it thought to establish a central register of best copies.
1988	By 1972 Warren J. Haas, chair of the Association of Research Libraries' Preservation Committee, had prepared a report rethinking those recommendations.
1988	While advocating the same roles for a national preservation program as Williams had, Haas proposed that these could be fu lfille d more pragmatically by a 31 "preservation consortium" than by a central national agency.
1988	In the sixties and seventies several important research libraries began formal preservation programs, among these the Newberry, Yale, and the New York Public Library.
1988	Peter Waters, Christopher Clarkson, and Don Etherington, British designer/binders and book conservators, came to the Library of Congress, helping to develop its preservation program, and the work of other English conservation experts such as Roger Powell and Sidney Cockerell influenced American preservation technique and thinking.
1988	The New England Document Conservation Center, the first cooperative workshop established primarily to preserve and Of the fires and floods at home and abroad covered in the 29 the 1966 Florence flood was the most 400   restore library materials, opened its doors in 1973.
1988	Since that time, other cooperative centers or regional programs have been established, such as the Book Preservation Center at the New York Botanical Garden and the Research Libraries Group's preservation program.
1988	In 1979, to promote a different type of cooperation and standardization, the National Endowment for the Humanities awarded the Association of Research Libraries a grant for a project, under the directorship of Pamela Darling, to design a self-study preservation planning procedure 32 for use by individual libraries.
1988	While preservation publishing had begun in other countries, the 1970's saw the development of an American preservation press, including such publications as the Abbey Newsletter (1975) and Conservation Administration News (1979).
1988	Conferences, such as Deterioration and Preservation of Library Materials (University of Chicago Graduate Library School) were held.
1988	Library schools lik e those at Columbia, Chicago, Maryland, and the University of California, Berkeley, began to offer preservation seminars and courses.
1988	Research, particularly in deacidification, progressed on several fronts as the Barrow Research Laboratory, Richard Smith, and the Library of Congress all worked on 33 nonaqueous processes.
1988	In 1981, Columbia University's School of Library Service became the nation's firs t degree-granting conservation education program and admitted its initial class of students.
1988	With this, library conservation moved an important step further in establishing its e lf as the "distinct professional discipline" with fully developed and recognized methods, standards, ethics, and educational programs to which Paul Banks refers in his article "Preservation of Library 401   OA Materials" in the Encyclopaedia of Library and Information Science.
1988	The eighties also saw the Library of Congress pioneer the use of optical disk technology for preservation purposes, and, despite accidents and political setbacks, continue its research on diethyl zinc as a deacidification agent.
1988	This work was of enormous importance, as few publishers other than university presses used neutral paper, and new books seemed as doomed as those already crumbling on library shelves.^� The national preservation program envisioned by Williams and Haas seemed somewhat nearer in 1984, as the Council on Library Resources (under the leadership of Haas, now its president) convened a study group of librarians, scholars, and university administrators to consider again this possibility.
1988	The group recommended the creation of the Commission on Preservation and Access whose work i t would be to support, coordinate, and develop funding for a decentralized national program.
1988	In 1987, as American library leaders testified before the United States Congress about the acute nature of "the brittle books problem," Patricia Battin (who had succeeded Haas as Columbia University's Vice-President for University Libraries when he assumed the presidency of CLR and whose career reflects a serious interest in 36 preservation matters) was appointed the Commission's firs t chair.
1988	While a hundred years had passed since turn-of-the-century librarians began discussing the s till unsolved "brittle books problem,'' American librarians seemed better positioned than at any other time in their history seriously to address this issue, called by the Librarian 37 of Congress "'one of our most pressing national problems.'"
1988	volumes had perished, and most contemporary books seemed fated to Many 402   follow their example.
1988	Although the library editions printed on sound paper for which earlier librarians sued had not come to pass, the technologies of film and optical disk promised that intellectual content, i f not the artifact its e lf, could survive to be studied by future generations.
1988	Clearly, the preservation activity which began in turn-of-the-century American lib ra rie s increased as the twentieth century progressed, the most notable advances having occurred since 1960.
1988	Several reasons for this suggest themselves.
1988	Of course, the World Wars interrupted most aspects of American culture, research, and scholarship; little progress (except for work related to disaster preparedness) might be expected during these periods or the years of recovery which followed.
1988	Further, the third quarter of the twentieth century brought remarkable scientific achievements�achievements whose preservation possibilities librarians presiding over enormous deteriorating collections were eager to explore.
1988	Nevertheless, the simple existence of large, decaying collections and potential scientific solutions may not be enough to explain why preservation interest and activity burgeoned post-1960--why preservation of library materials, like that of architectural landmarks, became during this period a virtual "cultural crusade."
1988	In fact, the library community's concern with the conservation of library materials may be related to the nation's growth of interest in preserving other parts of its cultural heritage.
1988	Like library preservation, architectural conservation began as a grass-roots movement in America.
1988	From 1850 u n til the post-World War I I establishment of the National Trust for Historic Preservation (1949) 403   landmark preservationists worked d ilig e n tly , but without a national organization and clearly defined leadership.
1988	Much war.
1988	accomplished during this early period, as landmarks such as Mount Vernon, the Old South Meeting House, and Williamsburg were claimed, preserved, or restored, but i t was the 1960's that witnessed the major flu rry of activity which included the passing of the Historic Preservation Act of 38 preservation has continued to grow at the local, regional, and national levels.
1988	I t may be that this heightening of interest in two parallel areas�the preservation of our intellectual and physical history--shares some common explanation.
1988	The 1960's saw a considerable stirring of interest in the things of the past.
1988	Perhaps this young nation was beginning to come of age; another possibility is that the period of prosperity represented by the 1960's provided Americans more free time to consider and pursue their cultural heritage.
1988	"'Whatever the case may be,'" wrote one architectural historian, "'the fact is that historical sites, old buildings, forts, covered bridges, and other visible manifestations of our past way of life are enjoying an 39 1966.
1988	Like the work of library conservation, that of architectural unprecedented degree of attention from the public at large.'"
1988	might easily add "old books, documents, and manuscripts" to this lis t, and argue that the nation's bicentennial year, which followed in the next decade, served to maintain the American fascination with the past and its monuments, whether paper or stone.
1988	Thus, the "cultural crusade" for library preservation which began in the 1960's and continues today may have grown from more than the presence o f a problem of considerable national magnitude and the availability of potential One 404   solutions: perhaps the strong interest of the American public in its past was the stimulus needed for an organized, systematic effort to begin.
1988	Library preservation has advanced from a state of simple activity at the turn of the century to become a modern twentieth century movement characterized by the organization, funding, and concern that such a word implies.
1988	Thus, it is not surprising that the major preservation interests of the late nineteenth century (book construction, binding materials, mending practices) are quite different from those of the present (the impermanence of book papers, the need to preserve large quantities of embrittled materials, the distribution of responsibility for preserving materials).
1988	These shifts in emphasis are the outgrowth of the intensification and systemization of the American preservation concern, as well as modern scientific advances.
1988	At the turn of the century, preservation was one of many issues competing for librarians' attention, as a new profession developed its ethics, methods, and collections.
1988	While there was clear interest in preservation issues, that interest was perhaps not as intense as i t is today, when the mission and systems of librarianship are much more settled and deteriorating collections considerably larger.
1988	Additionally, nineteenth century librarians were a pragmatic lo t, interested in housekeeping and book supports; their twentieth century counterparts concern themselves with the outcomes of scientific research.
1988	Second, late nineteenth century preservation lacked the organized, systematic approach which characterizes the present, as the American Library Association, the Council on Library Resources, the 405   Association of Research Libraries, and the Federal government work together in developing a decentralized national preservation program.
1988	Finally, faced with cheap publishers' bindings and having no solutions for the problems of inherent vice, turn-of-the-century librarians had little choice but to make their intellectual and financial commitment to the external book, concentrating on the preservation of its protective shell, the binding.
1988	Today, sophisticated deacidification research, coupled with film and d ig ita l reproduction techniques, has led librarians to focus on the heart of the preservation problem, permanent book papers and the preservation of intellectual content.
1988	In Sum In response to the aging and growth of American library collections, urban environmental problems, and changes in manufacturing methods for books and book papers, between 1876 and 1910 preservation interests grew from simple custodial and mending routines to include concern for the qualities of the materials which made up the book, the construction of the modern volume, and the need for a method of preserving at least the content of badly deteriorated yet valuable materials.
1988	By the close of the period, a fair amount of cooperative activity, in terms of lobbying for better made books, quality binding materials, and binding standards is observable.
1988	It would be difficult to overestimate the role that Library Journal and the American Library Association played in spreading the word about preservation practices, concerns, and research efforts, and thereby furthering interest in such matters across the nation.
1988	406   Some might argue that much of what passed for preservation work in general collections of this period was actually simple library economy: responding to Dewey's philosophy, librarians concerned themselves with mending, binding, standards, and sturdier publishers' editions more from a sense of fiscal prudence than the wish to preserve their collections for future generations; the better a book was made, mended, or bound, the longer i t would serve the contemporary public.
1988	It is probably true that not every circulating collection (perhaps smaller society or public libraries were especially vulnerable) perceived or could afford to adopt a preservation mission; books purchased may have been chiefly for popular reading, discarded when they wore out and replaced with newer title s .
1988	However, there is broad evidence in the literature and internal library documents of the period that a large number of libraries, and library types, considered at least portions of their collections to be of permanent value and wished them to last indefinitely.
1988	While there existed no functional area of library work called "preservation," it would be a mistake to suppose little interest.
1988	Preservation may not have been viewed as the unit of activities (environmental protection, custodial measures, s ta ff and reader education, binding, repair, reprography) assembled by late twentieth century librarians, although, with the exception of photoreproduction and the atmospheric controls made possible by modern science, these measures were all present in turn-of-the-century American libraries; one could contend that the local library's preservation procedures have changed very l i t t l e .
1988	In contrast, the major preservation interests at the turn of the century were quite different from those of the present, 407   largely because of the late twentieth century intensification and systemization of preservation concern.
1988	Additionally, the possibilities offered by modern science have permitted librarians to focus on the internal book, while their predecessors had little choice but to concentrate on its shell.
1988	This study, a representation of preservation thought and activity during the early years of American librarianship, provides a basis for the examination and analysis of the work in the decades to follow; it sets the stage for the "cultural crusade" of the la te twentieth century.

1988	Acknowledgements
1988	AOaCWLEDGMENTS While a completed dissertation bears the single name of the student, the process that leads to this accomplishment is always in combination with the dedicated work of other people.
1988	I wish to acknowledge my appreciation to certain people.
1988	Dr. Terry L. Weech, co-ohvur of my dissertation committee, has been extremely helpful to me during my entire period of studies at the University of Illinois.
1988	As the Chairman of the Advanced Studies Committee at the time of my application for admission, Dr. Weech never failed to provide me with the information I needed.
1988	As co-chair of my committee, he worked closely with me during the proposal writing and during the period of my dissertation.
1988	Dr. Lawrence W. S. Auld, also co-chair of my committee, has been a friend and father to me, just as he was to all foreign students and many others in the library school.
1988	He was always ready to give advice on and listen to questions relating to both academic and personal work.
1988	His assistance to me during the period of the proposal and dissertation was immense.
1988	Dr. Linda C. Smith, member of my committee, has been a positive influence on me through her patience, objective and meticulous criticism of my work, including the proposal and the dissertation.
1988	Dr. Smith's hard work, and the end}ess hours she spent in the library school justified my adopting the library school as a second home, working relentlessly to finish my work on time.
1988	vi   I was fortunate enough to work as the graduate assistant for Dr. Selma Richardson, member of my committee.
1988	Dr. Richardson's interest in international librarianship encouraged me to pursue my topic on international students.
1988	She provided me with an insight into possible issues t h a t needed exploration for the dissertation.
1988	Her immense help during the proposal and dissertation writing can never be sufficiently described b y me.
1988	Ms. Lizabeth Wilson, a member on my committee, and director of the Undergraduate Library, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, was very instrumental in my selecting international students as a topic for my dissertation.
1988	Her bibliographic instruction class I took in the Summer of 1985 and the opportunity I had working for her as a bibliographic instructor in the Undergraduate Library broadened my horizon on the problems and concerns of library use among foreign as well as domestic students.
1988	Ms. Wilson's relentless assistance to me when I was writing the proposal and the dissertation will always be appreciated by me.
1988	I could not have gone through the doctoral program without the financial assistance provided by the Graduate School of Library and Information Science of the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign.
1988	I would like to express my full appreciation to the staff and faculty of the school for their generous support, both financially and morally.

1988	She was supportive of me during my students days at the University of Illinois, and she stood by me when I was working on the dissertation.
1988	I could never have done anything without the love, support, and understanding of my wife.
1988	I do also wish to thank my son Kofi for doing his best to understand a father who had to be away for such a long time, and still came back, malting the computer center and the library his home.
1988	I am extremely grateful to my parents, Mr. Thomas Kwaku Mensah, retired Education Officer in Ejisu, Ashanti Ghana, and Madam Akua Barnie, also of Ejisu.
1988	They made a difference in my life by sacrificing to send me to school when many of my classmates did not have the opportunity to further their education beyond the elementary school level.
1988	My Ph.D would never have become a reality if my parents had not sacrificed the little money they had to send me to secondary school.
1988	MybrothersStephenBonsu,P�iulAgyeman,JohnKofiMensahand James (Kwame) Mensah merit a mention for their continuous support of me during the entire period of my education.
1988	I need to mention the inspiration provided by my eldest brother, Stephen Bonsu, whose pioneering efforts in education left a contagious desire on us all in the family to do the best in school.

1989	Acknowledgements
1990	ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS One of the pleasures in preparing the final copy of a dissertation is the opportunity to thank the many individuals who contributed so freely of their knowledge, time, energy and support.
1990	My advisor and major professor, Jane Robbins, guided me through the entire doctoral program, offering her unique blend of direction, so important to a novice, together with the freedom to set my own course and examine the questions that I found significant.
1990	Her sage advice, encouragement, and camaraderie enabled me to pursue old as well as new ideas and to complete my dissertation.
1990	The other members of my committee Doug Zweizig, Jim Krikelas, John Boll, Dennis Dresang also gave generously of their time and talents.
1990	They opened up new worlds of thought and assisted me in developing the necessary background and skills to carry out my studies.
1990	I am grateful as well to my fellow doctoral students especially Prudence Dalrymple, Debra Wilcox Johnson, Pat Lund, Sally Roggia for the hours we spent talking over ideas and fostering our individual progress through the doctoral program.
1990	The General Library System, in the persons of Kaye Gapen, Frank Bright, and all the staff in Central Technical Services, demonstrated their ii   support for my doctoral program in many practical ways, including rearranging meeting schedules, testing the survey instrument, and providing time off from the library.
1990	I owe a special thanks to the librarians and staff at the University of Illinois/Urbana-Champaign Library, as well as to selected faculty outside the library, who provided the information and insights that made this dissertation possible.
1990	In particular, the following individuals provided answers to the many questions I asked about the Library: Hugh C. Atkinson, Michael Gorman, Dale Montanelli, Bart Clark, Paula Watson, Arnold Wajenberg, Carl Deal and David Bishop.
1990	Last, but only in the traditional listing, I thank my best friend, Tom Smith, whose love and friendship supported me at every step of the way, and my family, who put up with the occasional visit in support of my studies.

1990	ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This thesis would not have been possible without the encouragement and friendship of my supervisor, Dr. Georgios Doukidis.
1990	Georgios has given me so many opportunities in the years that I have known him that I cannot hope to ever repay him for what he has done for me.
1990	In some small way, Georgios, I hope that this thesis will be able to say thank you for everything that you have done for me.
1990	Special thanks are also due Georgios' fiancee Lina Vantziou, who acted as messenger between Georgios and myself.
1990	I am also indebted to Dr. Tony Cornford who became my `local supervisor' when Georgios was required to go to Greece.
1990	Without his support and encouragement this thesis would still be no more than hazy ideas rather than a properly presented argument.
1990	I have also benefitted greatly from his views on my work and his friendship.
1990	To my parents, who have given me so much love, I am dedicating my thesis.
1990	They, and the rest of my family, have taught me the most important lessons about life, love and friendship.

1990	Last, but by no means least, I am grateful for the love and companionship of all my friends who kept me happy and `sane' while I was researching my thesis.
1990	Their patience was particularly appreciated when I became `anti-social' in the final stages of preparing the thesis.
1990	Special thanks go to my mentor and friend, Scott Lucas who was the first PhD student I met at university and who has been a dear, close friend ever since.
1990	The first two years of this research were supported by an SERC research studentship no.

1994	I especially thank W an Liu, Joe Scuderi, Gail Gruninger and Anna Livia.
1994	Also, remembered are two who left too young - Michael Morris, may he rest in peace, who always expressed his admiration of my accomplishments and ability to juggle family, school, and work; and Ellen Powell Tiberino, may she rest in peace, who valued my creative abilities and entertained me with stories when times where tough: each was an incredible inspiration in patience, perservence and celebration.
1994	Nine years ago I had the privledge to study under Elizabeth Hoffman.
1994	It was through her acquaintance and influence that I enrolled at CIS.
1994	I thank her personally for opening worlds for me which have yielded much happiness and satisfaction.
1994	This work would not have been completed without the support of relatives, especially my mother-in-law, Elaine Brown, and my parents, Sam and Nell Harris, from whom I learned to set higher goals and to find the tenacity to reach them.
1994	My children Gabriel and Kajsa were sufficiently patient and self-sufficient during the years of classes and research and grew to be confidantes who shared in the tales and tribulations of studenthood.

1996	Acknowledgements
1996	ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS I wish to express my sincere gratitude to Prof. AJ.Meadows, as my supervisor, who provided prompt and effective guidance, encouragement and generous assistance throughout each stage of my work, as my teacher, who gave me precious lessons about research, and as my friend, for the help and kindness given to me during the period of my stay in Great Britain.
1996	I also wish to thank Dr. Paul Sturgess, for his encouragement and support.

1996	Special gratitude is offered for detailed editing by Phil Sadler.

1996	ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Although a dissertation is characteristically a work of original scholarship by an individual, its successful completion depends on the advice, assistance and contributions of many people.
1996	It is appropriate for me to acknowledge this assistance, and to recognize those who gave so willingly of their time, knowledge and resources.
1996	First and foremost, I wish to thank my advisor, Dr. Arlene G. Taylor, for her commitment to this dissertation during the protracted dismantling and dissolution of the School of Library Service.
1996	Although preoccupied with relocating her home and establishing herself in a new position at the University of Pittsburgh, Dr. Taylor's support never wavered, although frequently it had to be offered long distance, via phone or e-mail, or, if in person, during impromptu meetings at national conferences, or on odd flying visits to New York.
1996	Through it all, her belief in this dissertation sustained me.
1996	Secondly, I wish to thank my second reader, Dr. George Stade, for confirming my hope that my rather specialized research in bibliographic control might indeed have some wider application, and for believing v   that the results of my research might be of use to the reading public.
1996	Professor Stade's unlooked-for encouragement, and his belief that my desire to enhance the bibliographic record could cross disciplinary boundaries and benefit the study of literature as well, quite simply validated my research.
1996	I wish also to thank Dr. Richard P. Smiraglia, formerly my professor at the School of Library Service and currently my colleague at the Palmer School of Library and Information Science.
1996	It was Richard's course, Introduction to Bibliographic Control, that convinced me to become a cataloger; it was Richard's course in research methods that enabled me to design my doctoral research.
1996	I am especially grateful for Richard's willingness to discuss any aspect of research methodology anywhere and anytime, and also for his uncompromising standards as a cataloger, researcher, teacher and editor, which have given me something to aspire to.
1996	Finally, I wish to thank Dr. Phyllis Dain, teacher and mentor, in whose doctoral seminars this research first took shape, for teaching me, by example as much as anything else, what real scholarship is.
1996	Since the topical control of fiction by bibliographic control specialists is relatively new, I vi   would like to describe the debt I owe to Dr. Clare Beghtol.
1996	Clare's dissertation, on the classification of fiction, was both a precursor to, and a model for, my own.
1996	I found that, wherever I was in my research, Clare had been there before me.
1996	Besides leading the way, Clare, through her research, provided valuable reinforcement: it was exciting to examine a problem and find confirmation for my solution in the work of another researcher.
1996	Above all, I have Clare to thank for her masterly examination of the theoretical problems posed by expressing types of fictional data.
1996	In particular, it was her peerless analysis of the problems associated with anomalous content in data categories that enabled me to devise strategies for dealing with them effectively.
1996	At Columbia University, where I conducted my research, several librarians were crucial in helping me to translate my research design into reality: Cathy Thomas for suggesting a screen dump and securing it for me, and Stephen Davis for supplying it.
1996	Without their help, my research design would not have been feasible.
1996	On the personal front, as well as the professional, I have been fortunate to have had unfailing support.
1996	Sherry Vellucci, who preceded me in the doctoral program at SLS, has been unstinting with both advice and encouragement: besides being grateful to her for "showing vii   me the ropes," I must thank her for always being there for me, as mentor, confidante and friend.
1996	I owe a special thanks to Phil Clark, statistician extraordinaire, for rescuing me and my chi-squares and for showing me how to get them in shape for deposit.
1996	Thanks, Phil, and thank Ellen, too.
1996	Finally, the writing of this dissertation would not have been possible without my parents, Eve and Bill Hayes.
1996	I thank my father for his exaggerated estimation of my abilities, for the value he has always placed on scholarship, and for his willingness to assist me in any capacity, from editor to computer trouble-shooter to chauffeur.
1996	I thank my mother, whose support enabled me to enter the profession of my choice, for always believing in me, even when I did not believe in myself.

2001	1   Abstract The impact of the Intranet on knowledge management within an Omani organisational context is investigated.
2001	The main purpose is twofold, to investigate the use, benefit and impact of the Intranet on Omani organisations and to identify factors that make organisations successfulin using an Intranet.
2001	A quantitative survey is used as the main data collecting method, however, some qualitative means are used in each of two mini case studies to test the validity of the proposed model and inform a detailed case study.
2001	Using the strategy of multiple paradigms, the robustness of the results is shown to be increased and cross-validation is achieved.
2001	A number of statistical techniques such as descriptive statistic, Speraman correlation and regression are used to derive to the results.
2001	While most of the participants report the benefits from the use of the Intranet for their organisations in managing organisational knowledge, it is shown that currently Omani companies' experience is mostly limited to explicit knowledge.
2001	Furthermore, the empirical findings clearly link successwith positive interaction between IT staff training, management support, availability of funds, user participation and organisational culture factors.
2001	The results of logistic regression analysis suggest that 89% of the variation in the levelof Intranetusagewithin Omanicompaniesis attributedto thesefactors.
2001	The model presented not only gives a description of the use and benefits of the Intranet within Omani organisations but offers a prescription of the factors that need to be considered in the implementation of the Intranet and the consequent utilisation of the technology to its full potential.
2001	The factors are of great importance, particularly to practitioners hoping to change the attitudes and the behaviour of employees who are reluctant to actively participate in the acquisition and exchange of knowledge.
2001	In the adopting and implementing Intranet based strategies for knowledge management in Oman, it is vital that these factors are considered.
2001	ii   Practitioners and researchers alike will benefit from the results obtained.
2001	Researchers may benefit from the theoretical framework, which may form the basis for further empirical research.
2001	In addition, practitioners have gained models to guide them in implementing and using the Intranet to manage knowledge, the most valuable resource available to ensure organisational success.

2002	ABSTRACT by Jerry R. Brown As the use of the Internet and computer-based information technology in education increases, the role of secondary school libraries in preparing students for their futures as lifelong learners becomes ever more important.
2002	In order to meet that need, many of these libraries are hosting web pages.
2002	It is important that pages produced by and for libraries perform their task well.
2002	A review o f the literature for construction and content standards for library web pages was performed.
2002	Many books and articles discuss web page design, but few speak to content.
2002	The Missouri Department o f Secondary and Elementary Education list o f secondary schools with web sites was used as the subject group for this study.
2002	The researcher developed a basic survey o f design, content, and accessibility questions and visited each web site twice.
2002	The results of the surveys were used to develop design, content, and accessibility expectations for school library web pages.

2002	ACKNOWLEDGMENTS I welcome this opportunity to express my thanks to Professor L McEwaine for her expert guidance and invaluable support in the overall supervision of my research.
2002	Thanks are also due to Professor Hansen of the Faculty of Medicine, University of Oslo, for his interest and advice during the preliminary planning stage of this thesis.
2002	I wish to acknowledge the generous and kind assistance of the late Dr. Lisa Knarberg Hansen in giving me access to library catalogues and in enabling me to spend time talking to University of Oslo Library staff in the Faculty of Medicine.
2002	A special acknowledgement is also due to the following Librarians whose assistance in the course of this study was notably generous and appreciated: Frode Bakken, Heidi Boiesen, Mimi Dammen, Margaret Ellebye, Lasse Christensen, Aud Gulbrandsen, Kare Hansen, Greta Mole, Signe Nordensberg, Lise Refsum, Benta K. Rustad, Jo Tennfjord, and Kirsten B. Welhaven and Ellen 0yno.
2002	I value the continuous and patient assistance of Librarians in the Reading Room of the National Library and Lise Haaland in Bergen Public Library.
2002	The difficulties in tracing book production statistics for the earlier periods were alleviated by Malcolm Langley, Librarian in Queen Mary Intellectual Property Research Institute, University of London.
2002	Thanks to Charmian Brinson and Adrian Mole for reading and commenting on preliminary drafts of the text.
2002	I am indebted to the Director of Trauma and Orthopaedics at Basildon Hospital, (formerly Clinical Tutor) Mr N.B.
2002	Ker who provided practical support throughout the study.
2002	It would have been impossible to cross the North Sea as often as I have done during the period of this study, without the generosity of Librarian, Heidi Cortner Boiesen and her warmly welcoming family.
2002	Without the information technology support of Professor Mike Brinson, the thesis would have taken much longer to produce.
2002	The time of preparing this thesis has been a test for my friends who have tolerated my unsociable behaviour, and their loyalty is warmly appreciated.
2002	These principles however, do not propound stakeholder participation but rather stakeholder acknowledgment and consultation.
2002	Clarkson (1994) defines his essential core of stakeholders through their claims on the organisation.
2002	Claims can be through power, urgency and legitimacy but the essential claim is only through power and legitimacy.
2002	This view aligns with that of Wood (1994) who distinguishes between what he terms the 'bicycle wheel model' of stakeholder management where stakeholders are things to be managed and the interactive model which sees stakeholders as members of relationships mutually driven and not completely controlled by one party or another.

2002	He has taught me to persevere in the face of many frustrations, to always look beyond the immediate or easily seen picture to what is beneath, and to stretch my thinking to accommodate new ideas, implications, and possibilities.
2002	Without his continued support, I would have lost my way long ago.
2002	Most importantly, I thank my family for their love, support, and patience.

This setting is very similar to the setting sung today, but Work employs the major subdominant instead of the minor chords found in current versions at the setting of the word tremble.85 This valuable trail o f transmission through transcription reveals the malleable structure of African-American Spirituals, exhorting the leader to inteiject at will, constantly varying the song.

2002	The radio hosts discuss the first recordings o f Negro religious music.
2002	The recorded performances are of the Dinwiddle Colored Quartet from Victor in 1902.
2002	During the hosts’ discussion the Dinwiddle Colored Quartet is categorized with the Fisk Jubilee Singers because both performances are deemed Europeanized.
2002	The hosts recommend the use of the more authentic recordings from the 1920s later recordings for more historical accuracy.
2002	In these “authentic” recordings, preachers lead their congregations in singing.
2002	The preachers would use more extemporaneous call-and- response or lining of the hymn tunes than in a concert version of an African-American Spiritual.

2002	46   47 Among the organizations that early sought to build up the waste places of the South, and to carry there a higher religion and much needed education, was the American Missionary Association.
2002	This society has led all others in this greatly benevolent work, having reared no less than seven colleges and normal schools in various centres o f the South The principal one o f these is Fisk University, located in Nashville, Tennessee Shortly after the close of the war, a number of philanthropic persons from the North gathered into an old government building that had been used for storage purposes, a number o f freed children and some grown formed a school.
2002	The number of pupils rapidly increasing, it was soon found that better facilities were required Just how this was to be done, was, for a while, quite a knotty problem Its solution was attempted by... George L. White----- He had often been struck with the charming melody o f the “slave songs” he had heard sung by the children of the school.
2002	Believing that these songs— would fall with delightful novelty upon Northern ears, Mr. White conceived the idea o f taking a company o f the students on a concert tour over the country, in order to thus obtain sufficient funds to build a college.
2002	All arrangements completed; and the Jubilee Singers, as they were called, left Nashville in the Fall of 1871 for a concert-tour of the Northern United States 1have not the space to follow in detail this ambitious band o f singers throughout this country and in great Britain.
2002	The songs they sang were generally o f a religious character—“slave spirituals,”—and such as have been sung by the American bondmen o f the past.
2002	These had originated with the slave; had sprung spontaneously, from souls naturally musical.
2002	The strange melody o f these songs burst upon the Northern States and parts of Europe as a revelation in vocal music.
2002	Welcome...was extended to them all over the North.
2002	Thejournals of the day fairly teemed with praises o f them; and often, in larger cities, hundreds o f persons were turned away from the concert-hall... so great was the rush.
2002	After a while they visited England, where they sang before the Queen and others of the nobility, everywhere repeating the triumphs that had been theirs in this country.. .
2002	.
2002	It was not so much the words oftheir songs... as the strangely pathetic and delightful melody o f their music, and the freshness and heartiness o f the rendering, that gave them their greatest charm.
2002	This has been demonstrated in Holland and Switzerland, where these singers have drawn crowded and delighted audiences that neither speak nor understand a word of English: such is the beautiful, far-reaching power o f this, in the truest sense “music o f the heart.” I might.. .fill many pages with the comments made upon these charming singers by the American press both before and after their trip to England.
2002	In the summer o f 1874 they returned to Nashville, having given two seasons o f concerts in this country, and one in great The First Choir Tours James M. Trotter offers an African-American's description of the early schools created for freed slaves in the 1860s.

2002	At the present writing (June 1877) the Jubilee Singers are making a tour o f the Continent.
2002	They are now in Holland.
2002	The songs they sang were for the present, forming a delightful novelty, and service a noble purpose.
2002	Still it must be sadly remembered that these Jubilee songs sprang from a former life of enforced degradation... and notwithstanding their great beauty o f melody, sensitive members o f the race represented, these reminders were o f the most painful nature.92 The history of the Fisk choir is of great interest to researchers.
2002	More important, Fisk’s choir of ex-slaves secured the survival and transmission of the African-American Spiritual from the plantation to the concert stage.
2002	In the early years of Fisk, “students sang the songs o f their people after rehearsals, a recreation that was not encouraged by some of the faculty.
2002	During these impromptu singing sessions, it seems likely that they taught each other a common repertory [of] evolved versions [of the songs] that pleased their trained ears.”93 The Fisk choir tour was to raise money for the school, but the tour was not profitable until they incorporated concert versions of the old plantation songs.
2002	Where the minstrel troupes embraced the plantation songs, the students at the African-American universities were not inclined to sing the plantation songs because o f the connection to slavery.

2002	Roach explains: Understandably, [African-Americans after slavery] wished to retain only that which was free—free ofanything peculiar to the illusions and institutions of slavery.... Fortunately, the Fisk singers were finally persuaded to sing spirituals in order to raise funds for the school, not then a university The sincere desire for the continuation o f their education inspired them to abandon former prejudices against the spirituals.95 They toured the United States, traveled to England, and sang for the monarchy.
2002	Eventually the choir returned to Fisk triumphant in their financial endeavors.
2002	The Hampton Institute Jubilee Singers were the second touring choral group to achieve financial success through incorporating the old plantation songs into their concert programs.
2002	A Hampton program in 1874 included the Spirituals E f You Want to See Jesus; Go in de Wilderness; Oh, de 01 ’Sheep Dun Know de Road; My Lord, What a Morning; Jerusalem Morning; The Great Camp Meeting; Plenty o fRoom; and Peter, Go Ring Them Bells.96 Consequently, the American and European tours of the Hampton choirs during Reconstruction raised an unexpectedly large amount of money and the tours were viewed “vindicating triumphs” over the past injustice of slavery.97 Although the touring choirs were reluctant, the inclusion of the plantation songs into their concerts provedtheinterestinthemusicpriortoEmancipation.

2002	Anderson explains, “Some in the audience expected comedic minstrelsy entertainment and ridiculed the college students for refusing to gratify White expectations for Black self-mockery.”100 After Emancipation, touring choirs from African-American universities and theatrical groups disseminated the songs advertised as the songs the slaves sang “before the war.” 98Portia K.

2002	African-American classical musicians adapted the slave music for their performing needs attempting to preserve the African-American Spiritual.109Even though newer musical styles retained the freedom of pitch, rhythm, and structure o f the African-American Spiritual, they divided its essence.
2002	The Blues adopted the sorrow o f the slave songs; Ragtime embraced the joy; Gospel accepted the sacred component, and Jazz transposed the rhythmic intensity and improvisational freedom of plantation bondage into the music o f urban freedom.

2002	CHAPTER V CONCLUSION The purpose o f this study was to examine personal papers, scores, and media concerning the African-American Spiritual housed in Special Collections of selected North Carolina libraries.
2002	The collections surveyed in Salisbury, Chapel Hill, and Durham haveprovidedmuchinformation.
2002	TheNegroYearBookpublicationsatSalisbury’s Livingstone College are part of a larger ongoing project to document the history of African Americans.
2002	Once completed, the project at Livingstone will have more primary sources for examination.
2002	In Chapel Hill, the digitized slave narratives and the handwritten papers o f Guy Benton Johnson provide firsthand accounts o f the African- AmericanSpiritualandaEuropean-American’sstudyofthemusic,respectively.
2002	In Durham, the first edition books at North Carolina Central University and the Stanford L. Warren Library continue to build their holdings concerning African-American history.
2002	The Stanford L. Warren Library incorporates newly published books discussing African- American life.
2002	At Duke University, the Negro Camp Meeting papers, broadsides, and playbills wereunexpecteddiscoveriesofthisresearch.
2002	TheCampMeetingpapersrevealmuch about the origins of the African-American Spiritual in reference to the sacred function of the music along with the presence and participation of both Whites and Blacks at the camp meeting.
2002	Also, they reveal identifiable elements of performance as well as one type ofdissemination(i.e.,communityperformance)oftheAfrican-AmericanSpiritual.

2002	59   60 the stereotypical portrayal of African-Americans but also the popularity of the “plantation songs.” These songs continue to interest amateurs and professionals in search of answers pertainingtoorigins,performance,anddissemination.
2002	SpecialCollectionsinNorth Carolina will continue the difficult task o f documenting this oral tradition.
2002	With no scores until the arrangements in the 1870s, research concerning the origination of these songs has depended on first-hand accounts of observers.
2002	The “evidence” of which came first—the “Black” or White” Spiritual—is contradictory.
2002	Researchers will have to accept that “Black” and “White” Spirituals originated in sacred settings and in various life experiences, blending of African and European traditions.
2002	With regard to the performance of the plantation songs, even with knowledge of the “origins” of African-American Spirituals, the musical and sociological traits which have been discussed, and an awareness o f the functional use o f the songs in the lives o f the slaves, a performance could not replicate the context of the slave experience in which thesesongswereused.
2002	Fortunately,slaves,ex-slaves,arrangers,compilers,and performers have discussed the African-American Spiritual referring to its bending of pitches, syncopation, freedom o f rhythm, improvisational structure, use o f call-and- response, and texts with multiple meanings.
2002	Would American music have the Blues, Ragtime, Gospel, and Jazz if the plantation songs or their remnants were not heard in urban areas, away from the southern plantations?
2002	The singers o f Fisk University and similar choirs, the producers of Negro theatrical groups, and the African-American composers of the first half of the twentieth century reluctantly embraced, overtly exploited,andtreasuredthetraditionalplantationsongs,respectively.

2002	61 American Spiritual survives in the twenty-first century as a symbol of slavery, a source for musical composition, a standard o f choral repertoire, and a call for justice sung during civil rights protests (e.g., We Shall Overcome).
2002	The documentary evidence survives for further scrutiny.
2002	Many o f the questions concerning the origin, performance, and dissemination o f the African-American Spiritual may never fully be resolved, but collections in North Carolina maintain much pertinent information and continue to collect it.
2002	Personal papers, scores, and media in Special Collections in North Carolina provide many voices concerning the past and will protect them for the future.
2002	When Fenner published the Cabin and Plantation Songs of the Hampton Students in 1883, he wrote concerning the study o f the African-American Spiritual: The slave music o f the South presents a field for research and study very extensive and rich, and one which has been scarcely more than entered upon.
2002	There are evidently, I think, two legitimate methods of treating this music: either to render it in its absolute, rude simplicity, or to develop it without destroying its original characteristics; the only proper field for such development being in the harmony... .
2002	Another obstacle to its rendering is the fact that tones are frequently heard which we have no musical characters to represent Such, for example, is that which I have indicated as nearly as possible by the flat seventh, in “Great Camp-meetin ’” “Hard Trials, ”and others.
2002	These tones are variable in pitch, ranging through an entire interval on different occasions, according to the inspiration o f the singer.
2002	They are rarely discordant and often add a charm to the performance.
2002	It is o f course impossible to explain them in words, and to those who wish to sing these songs, the best advice is that most useful in learning to pronounce a foreign language: Study all the rules you please; then-go listen to a native.
2002	[African-American Spirituals are the] natural outpouring of their sorrows and longings, are dying off, and if efforts are not made for its preservation, the country will soon have lost this wonderful music o f bondage.110 ll0Fenner, Cabin and Plantation Songs, Preface.

2002	ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This dissertation took me across the country and across the academic disciplines.
2002	As a result, the past four years have led me to countless individuals— some well-known, some anonymous—who have helped me to develop as a scholar and who have positively impacted this research project.
2002	I am greatly indebted to all, and deeply thankful.
2002	First, I must thank Dr. Neil Postman, Dr. Andrew Ross, and Dr. Jean-Louis Cohen, my three committee members, for their patience, their willingness to trust me with this unconventional topic, and their encouraging words and thoughtful criticism.
2002	Great thanks, too, to Dr. Mark Crispin Miller, my mentor, who convinced me during my very first semester of graduate school that I belonged there, and that I had this dissertation in me; I simply had to put my heart and mind to the task o f finding the topic and bringing it to fruition.
2002	To Mark’s wife, Amy Smiley, I am also grateful.
2002	Thank you also to Aurora Wallace, Christine Nystrom, Jonathan Burston, Arvind Rajagopal, Eric Saranovitz, M. J.

2002	Thanks to Deborah Jacobs, Jill Jean, Alexandra Harris, Carey Cook Petersen, and Stacy Carter o f the Seattle Public Library and Libraries for All Capital Projects for the phone interviews, informal conversations, and roundtable discussions—and for allowing me to rifle through their filing cabinets, blueprints, and unlabeled drawers; and to usurp their conference room, on occasion, for a workspace.
2002	The staff and administration deserve a special thank you for accommodating me during the undoubtedly frantic summer o f 2001, shortly after they moved every book, computer, desk, chair, and body from the old library into a temporary facility in preparation for the demolition and new construction.
2002	I also greatly appreciated having the opportunity to speak with Linda Larson of the Library Board and Evanne Vaivadas and Barbara Gregory from the Seneca Group.
2002	Thank you, too, to Bob Zimmer o f LMN Architects and Jan Knikker o f OMA for their time and encouragement.

2002	First of all, I could not have completed this dissertation without the guidance of my adviser and dissertation chair, Professor Douglas Zweizig.

2003	ACKNOWLEDGMENTS I could not have undertaken this research and writing without the support of a network of friends and colleagues, both in person and over the Internet.
2003	I am sure there are many who are unaware that a chance remark challenged an assumption I held or a joke they told helped energize me.
2003	From the circle of knitters at a local yarn store to chance encounters in coffee shops to people in small rooms throughout the city and over the Internet who offer experience, strength, and hope, I have met with unbelievable caring over the past several years.
2003	I cannot name you all, so thank you in general now.
2003	Thanks to Dr. Suzanne Damarin, who offered me an opportunity to read, think, and talk about ideas that will nourish my mind and spirit for the rest of my life.
2003	I appreciate deeply the time and energy you have spent on my behalf over the past years.
2003	I welcome the intellectual challenges you provide; you never let me be satisfied with the easy answer.
2003	You understood the frustration I felt when you and I realized that OSU's Web search could not locate the OSU Libraries' information page if one searched by "library."
2003	That observation and our discussion of it led to this research, this manuscript, and your belief in me made the process possible.
2003	iv  Thanks to Dr. Brenda Dervin.
2003	You agreed to serve on my committee at the very end of my process, before you met me or read my work, and in spite of your other obligations.
2003	I value the theories and methodology you have spent your career writing about; my work would be the poorer without your scholarship.
2003	Thanks to Dr. Richard Voithofer.
2003	You encouraged me in this process from our first meeting and offered the fruits of your experience in how to persevere with the writing of a dissertation.
2003	Your advice gave me a model for discipline that helped me finish.
2003	Thanks to Anne, Beautiful, Beth, Danya, Elizabeth Rose, Honest, Jeanie, Julie, Keziah Ruth, Miracle, Patricia, Sandra, and Terry.
2003	You each generously gave your attention, made observations, and shared some of your precious time with me.
2003	Your voices and faces, your observations and questions, reminded me that this work might be worth the doing, even when it was so cold that my fingers could not type.
2003	My best to each of you.
2003	Thanks to Dr. Linda Condron, debriefer, colleague and friend.
2003	From salmon on your grill to coffee at Stauf's, you offered a haven and a heart.
2003	You never forgot how difficult the process sometimes looks.
2003	That a dear friend also values convoluted discussions about technology and feminism is a gift beyond all expectations.
2003	Blessings.
2003	v  Thanks to Dr. Carol Damian, Judy Ridgway, Norma Bruce, and Margaret Gunthorp Bailey, who served as debriefers.
2003	You listened, gave feedback, and asked hard questions.
2003	Your attention was invaluable, as was that of Tracy Crow.
2003	Many thanks for editing the manuscript and for asking for a sweater.
2003	Thanks to the people who work for or with several organizations: ENC, The Ohio State University Libraries, and the libraries that cooperate through OhioLINK.
2003	The staff of ENC has always encouraged me to continue my research and studies.
2003	The OSU Libraries have a superb reference staff and offer invaluable services (including 24-hour access to the Engineering Library).
2003	Ohio academic organizations are generous, indeed, to participate in OhioLINK and I thank them for it.
2003	Finally, thanks to Sadie, Shadow, and Isabella.
2003	You remind me daily of priorities; there is nothing more important than fresh water, clean litter, plenty of kibbles, brushed fur, and jaw scratches.
2003	Your only interest in this is how it has grabbed my attention away from you and generated piles of paper to scatter and chase.
2003	My life would be impoverished without your presences.

2006	ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The list of friends, colleagues, librarians, scholars, bibliographers, and collectors who have assisted me with this work is extensive.
2006	I am especially grateful to my committee members for the support they gave me from the inception of this project, they are: Mark Samuels Lasner, my friend and mentor, who introduced me to bibliographical studies and the world of rare books, advised and corrected my work, and provided material and fraternal support in ways too numerous to mention here; Margaret Stetz, my director, who painstakingly read and reread my work and always pushed it to a higher level; Ann Ardis, who supported my move into an entirely new academic discipline; and Thomas F. Staley, who made his wide knowledge of John Rodker fully accessible to me.
2006	I must acknowledge Joan Rodker, who encouraged my study of her father�s work, welcomed me into her London home, answered all my questions, and gave me tea.
2006	My sincere appreciation goes to Terry Belanger, who provided mentorship, technical direction, and the expertise of his considerable bibliographical knowledge; and to Richard Noble and David Whitesell, who took turns playing Virgil to my Dante in the underworld of Bowersiana.
2006	My deepest personal acknowledgements go to my closest colleague, Ms. Lejla Kucukalic, who was there for me throughout, particularly during the lowest moments when I most needed picking-up.
2006	She tolerated extended dinnertime explications of watermarks and binding variations, endured the proliferation of catalogues, bibliographies, and books bearing Rodker�s imprint, and the subsequent loss of a living room.
2006	Thank you Leki, hvala ljubavi moja.
2006	v  The following all generously helped me track down books, references, archives, and other details relating to John Rodker and his circle of associates: John Buchtel, Steve Crook, James Cummins, Pat Fox, Rick Gekoski, Terry Halladay, Susan Helpern, Clive Hurst, Elizabeth Jenkins, Dave Kelly, Rebecca Johnson Melvin, Peter Joliff, Julie Anne Lambert, Graham Lane, Edward Maggs, Bradford Morrow, Timothy Murray, Arvid Nelsen, Richard Oram, Marilyn Parr, Richard Price, Charles Robinson, Jesse Rossa, Carol Rothkopf, Linda Stein, Patricia Willis, Ian Willison, Howard Woolmer, and the dozens of librarians who responded to my written inquiries.
2006	The rare book reading room staff at the following institutions also have my gratitude: the Beinecke Library, the Berg Collection, the Bodleian Library, the Boston Athenaeum, the British Library, the Folger Shakespeare Library, the Harry Ransom Center, Houghton Library, the Library of Congress, the New York Public Library, Princeton University, and the University of Virginia.
2006	Financial assistance from the following institutions is gratefully acknowledged: the Department of English at University of Delaware for a Graduate Student Travel Award; the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center at the University of Texas, Austin for a Dissertation Fellowship; the Bibliographical Society of America for a Research Fellowship; the William Reese Company for their Fellowship at Rare Book School that allowed me to attend the Introduction to Descriptive Bibliography course; and the University of Delaware Library for their continued support during my graduate studies.

2006	ACKNOWLEDGMENTS I hadn�t been working with school librarians for very long when it became clearly evident to me that the support of the building level principal was crucial to the vitality of the school library media program.
2006	I would like to thank all of the school library media specialists, especially those in Delaware, who helped me to see this connection and who suggested ways that I could best help them in advocating for information literacy programs in the schools.
2006	Credit also goes to Dr. Sharon Walpole who pointed out that not every school library media specialist was a contributor to an information literacy program in the schools and that I should not forget that communication is a two-way street.
2006	Dr. Robert Hampel patiently listened to all of my ideas and never patronized me when I talked about the importance of the school library media program in education.
2006	For that, I will always be truly grateful.
2006	It has been an honor to have had the opportunity to work with him.
2006	My research could not have been completed if it were not for all of the school library media specialists who responded to my survey and to the school principals who participated in the interviews.
2006	My thanks to the participants who gave me their time and shared their candid thoughts with me.
2006	Sharon Brubaker the school library media specialist at Henry M. Brader Elementary school, provided me with information about the school library media program and the trials and tribulations of integrating a library media program into the school curriculum.
2006	She graciously shared v  lesson plans, rubrics and photographs with me.
2006	I hope I have done justice to these materials.
2006	Of course, without the love and support of my family, this work would never have been attempted.
2006	To my husband, David, who happily listened to all of the sticky paragraphs and who encouraged my efforts every step of the way.
2006	To my amazing daughters, Rebekah and Hannah, whose good humor and love provided a welcome distraction to my work.
2006	Finally, to my mother and sister whose love is with me no matter how many miles separate us.
2006	To you all, I can only say that I am humbled by your love and faith in me.
2006	Thank you.
2006	vi
2006	ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS I would like to begin with thanks to my committee members for their guidance and understanding throughout this process.
2006	Special thanks go to my advisor, Dr. Janice Hinson, and to Dr. Margie Thomas for their encouragement.
2006	Without the support of my longsuffering husband, Bobby, this would not have been possible; he had a wife who was a professional student for much of our marriage � my deepest thanks to him.
2006	Thanks also go to my children, Kim, Bradley, and Farrah and their spouses, as well as my sister Joy for their words of support and their technical expertise when I needed them.
2006	None of this would have even begun had I not been encouraged and cheered on by the most faithful of friends, Debbie Henson.
2006	Special thanks go to Mitzi Trahan and Cindy Vavasseur for all their support throughout the research study.
2006	I am also thankful to my parents for instilling in me a love for lifelong learning and to my grandchildren for the many hours of pure fun they have brought to me.

2006	ACKNOWLEDGMENTS First and foremost, I would like to thank Dr. Natasha Levinson, who has had a significant influence on my scholarly life.
2006	Early in my doctoral work she opened intellectual doors for me that have challenged and shaped my thinking ever since.
2006	In addition, she, along with Dr. Averil McClelland, taught me that to be a great teacher is to be above all a careful, curious, and honest thinker.
2006	As the advisor of this dissertation, Dr. Levinson has been invaluable.
2006	She has listened to, encouraged, and challenged me.
2006	She has been a superb editor as well.
2006	Without her, this dissertation would probably not exist, and it would certainly not be what it is.
2006	I also owe a debt of gratitude to my committee members, Dr. Mary Stansbury and Dr. McClelland, for their help along the way.
2006	I particularly appreciate the input of the graduate faculty representative, Dr. Jason McGlothlin.
2006	There is no doubt this is a better dissertation because of his careful eye.
2006	My colleagues at the University of Kentucky have helped me through this in so many ways.
2006	Thanks especially to you, Lousetta, for lending me a hand when I needed one.
2006	To my two terrific daughters, Grace and Nina, I owe my gratitude for their patience during the many hours I spent away from them to complete this.
2006	You have often inspired me to keep at it, even when that seemed impossible.
2006	Finally, to my best friends, Jeff and Mom, thank you for listening to me and providing the kind of support and encouragement that helped me get this done.
2006	I am forever grateful for such a wonderful family.
2006	iii

2006	ACKNOWLEDGMENTS I would like to thank God, my family, my church family and my friends who believed in me, encouraged me and prayed for me until the completion of this work.
2006	To my mother who diligently served as proofreader, taskmaster and cheerleader... To my sister and brother-in-law who encouraged me during the worst times, wiped my tears and believed in me even when I didn�t believe in myself... To my �cyber� pastor who through prayer and that great smile pushed me through... To my sister circle of scholars who reminded that I wasn�t alone in this process... To the love of my life who learned all he could about this process, so that he could be a beacon of support in any way possible, who dazzled me through my moodiness and promised to do so forever...
2006	Finally, thank you to my advisor and committee members and especially my Clark Atlanta family who prepared me for this endeavor.
2006	v

2006	ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The successful completion of this dissertation is owed to a number of people.
2006	First, I would like to thank my committee: My dissertation advisor, Dr. Richard Cox, Elizabeth Yakel, Ellen Detlefsen, Margaret Kimmel, Joe Trotter, and Stephen Thomas.
2006	Words cannot express how indebted I am for their enduring support, commitment, understanding, and encouragement.
2006	I would especially like to thank Dr. Stephen Thomas and Highmark Blue Cross and Blue Shield for financial support to complete my research.
2006	I am grateful to the staff at the Southeast Region Center of the National Archives and Records Administration and to NARA�s Office of General Counsel for their assistance.
2006	NARA�s decision to open the medical records of the Tuskegee Syphilis Study in 2004 instead of 2030 is a personal triumph as well as a victory for those who now have the opportunity to view the records.
2006	I would also like to thank the individuals who were interviewed.
2006	The interviews were invaluable to this study.
2006	There are so many friends to thank for their undying support, love, devotion in making sure that I completed this study and school.
2006	Special thanks to my parents Ezra Whorley and Lucille Payne.
2006	I would especially like to thank my best friend Karen Carrington, Jennifer Marshall, Lynda Bishop, Elaine Westbrooks, Vanessa Pitts Bannister, Vendetta Knight, Marcy Walls, and Jeannette Bastian.
2006	When one decides to pursue a Ph.D., that person will need friends and family to rally around them, especially towards the end.
2006	I would say to all of you who were there for me: �I did not take your support for granted.
2006	This degree is as much yours as mine.� x
2006	applied to research / subject guides created by librarians.
2006	Creating / identifying / recognizing the labor and outcomes associated with a digital presence is paramount to the assessment and success of reference librarians in the networked environment.
2006	It is recognized and reaffirmed by experts � and the users in this study � that today�s student first try to acquire information on their own � via the web � before seeking a reference librarian�s assistance in the physical sense � so it is paramount that this work be supported and assessed in a statistically meaningful way for the reference librarian.
2006	Counting page use with comparisons to known user groups can help determine which users may be underserved; how a user navigates through a webpage can help determine link placement; observations of social networking technologies and their application to library webpage designs / functionality could bring reliable resources to the top of a students search more quickly; the acknowledgement that accessing of a reference librarian created resources is a reference function, a cyber-transaction, worth recording and applying credit or creating training opportunities.
2006	ACKNOWLEDGMENTS First and foremost, I would like to thank God Almighty for giving me so many opportunities to fulfill my dreams and more.
2006	Also, I would like to thank my committee members for their unrestricted support and guidance that resulted in this final manuscript.
2006	I would like to thank Dr. Ellen Detlefsen, doctoral committee chair, for her constant support and guidance towards achieving this final outcome.
2006	Further, I would like to thank Dr. Laurence Glasco, Dr. Sherry Koshman, and Dr. Stuart Shulman, for their invaluable time, support, and guidance.
2006	I would like to extend my gratitude to Dr. Mumtaz Anwar for being supportive of my educational endeavors, for caring, and for being an outstanding father-figure to me.
2006	Also, I would like to extend my gratitude to my professors in Kuwait including Dr. Taghreed Alqudsi- ghabra, Dr. Husain Al-Ansari, Dr. Sajjad ur Rehman, and Dr. Charlene Al-Qallaf, for their encouragement and support over the years.
2006	On a personal level, my thanks go to my relatives and friends in Pittsburgh and Kuwait especially Hassan Al-Abdullah and Mohammed Jamal, for being true friends.
2006	I would like to thank all of my family members, and my wife's family members, including her brother Ali, and uncle Najeeb, for their support and understanding.
2006	Other individuals I would like to thank include Dr. Hussain Dashti, Dr. Imad Dashti, Rasheed Al-Shimmari, Hakeem Al-Refaee, Essam Al-Ghanim, Amer Fardan, and Yousif Al-Ali.
2006	xiii  Finally, I would like to thank His Highness the Amir of Kuwait Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah and the late Amir His Highness Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah peace be upon him, for supporting students and education in Kuwait, and for giving me and all Kuwait citizens a chance to make our dreams a reality.

2006	ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS First do what is necessary; then do what is possible, and very soon you will be doing the impossible � St. Francis of Assisi.
2006	The words of this 13th century saint are no less true today than they were nearly 800 years ago when he offered them to his followers, who wondered how they could possibly carry on the work he had begun.
2006	This is also good advice for writing a dissertation.
2006	The very thought of such an undertaking is overwhelming; but if the work is done word by word, page by page, chapter by chapter, very soon one has accomplished what seemed to be impossible.
2006	Of course, nothing of this magnitude is accomplished without the support of family, friends, and colleagues.
2006	First and foremost, I extend my deepest gratitude to my husband Robert, whose unwavering support, encouragement, and love made the work possible.
2006	I also thank my parents, children, grandchildren, and all my family and friends for their understanding and patience.
2006	A special thank you is extended to my advisor, Dr. Wenfan Yan, for his encouragement, advice, and assistance throughout this process� and to my committee members, Dr. Cathy Kaufman and Dr. Robert Millward, for their contributions to this dissertation.
2006	Many thanks are due also to my colleagues at Saint Francis University for their encouragement and assistance.
2006	In particular I thank the librarian and faculty colleagues who participated in my study and these individuals: Rev.
2006	Gabriel Zeis, T.O.R., President, for his encouragement and support for my conducting this study at Saint Francis; Dr. Daniel Fredricks, who proofread my manuscript; Dr. Marnie Moist, who gave me much valuable assistance with my data analysis; and, Ms. Christina Baughman, who transcribed my focus group data and supported me in so many ways.
2006	Last, but certainly not least, I thank Dr. Kathleen Owens, President of Gwynedd-Mercy College and former Vice President for Academic Affairs at Saint Francis University, who encouraged me to consider a doctoral program in the first place.

2006	ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The first time I visited the campus of Oklahoma State University was in the mid- 1970s.
2006	I was in middle school and our band and orchestra traveled the 70 miles to compete in a music contest.
2006	We traveled by bus and by bus I do not mean a fully-loaded, air-conditioned, luxurious, travel coach, but an old yellow school bus with a busted headlight and broken tailpipe dragging behind.
2006	We did have air-conditioning and each seat had individual controls to regulate the air.
2006	All you had to do is simply reach up and slide down the window.
2006	Kids now days do not even know what it means to be hot.
2006	Try traveling halfway across Oklahoma in an old school bus wearing a heavy wool orchestra uniform.
2006	Funny, I do not even remember being hot.
2006	All I can remember is how excited I was to be going to Stillwater.
2006	When I first stepped off the bus I was immediately drawn to the campus.
2006	I knew from that moment on that I wanted to be part of OSU.
2006	I was fortunate after high school to be able to attend Oklahoma City University and the University of Oklahoma.
2006	However, I always carried with me the dream of someday attending Oklahoma State University.
2006	Twenty-five years later when I began thinking about a doctoral program, OSU was the first institution to enter my mind.
2006	I applied and was accepted, and learned that dreams really can come true.
2006	The selection of my committee was with purpose.
2006	I knew to be successful I had to recruit committee members of excellence.
2006	I have done that.
2006	Dr. Stansberry, thank you for serving as my outside member.
2006	I have valued your input and understanding of the iii  issues surrounding librarians and of librarianship.
2006	Dr. Pettibone, thank you for agreeing to initially serve as my committee chair and then continuing to serve on my committee after your retirement.
2006	It has been a joy working with you and I sincerely appreciate your advice and assistance.
2006	Dr. Johnson, you are a man for whom I have a great deal of respect.
2006	You have honored me by serving on my committee, thank you.
2006	Dr. Hyle, thank you for coming to my rescue and agreeing to serve as my dissertation advisor.
2006	Thank you for believing in me and for your leadership and direction.
2006	I knew from the first moment that I met you that you would be the one who would guide me through the dissertation process, and I was right.
2006	I do not know any other way to show my appreciation, but to say thank you.
2006	Completing the program would not have been possible with out the support of Rose State College.
2006	I especially wish to thank Ken Stockwell, Library Technical Assistant, for interlibrary loaning all the documents, articles, and books that I needed throughout this program.
2006	I know without a doubt that I would not have been successful without the support, camaraderie, and friendship of my fellow cohort members.
2006	We have laughed, cried, and argued, but through it all have developed lasting friendships.
2006	Getting to know each of you has been my greatest accomplishment during this program.
2006	Remember, it truly is �all about the LOVE.� � Mr. Russell Coker � Mr. Blake Fry � Dr. Alicia Harris (Fall 2006) � Dr. Molly Henderson (Spring 2006) iv  � Dr. Lori O�Malley (Spring 2006) � Mr. Bret Wood I also wish to acknowledge both my Cade and White families, especially Cheech.
2006	Mvto and thank you for your love, support, and prayers.
2006	Lastly, I wish to acknowledge myself.
2006	You have completed all of your coursework, passed your comprehensive examination, and successfully defended your proposal and dissertation.
2006	Feel good about what you have accomplished, always believe in yourself and your abilities, be humble in all that you do, and encourage others to reach for their dreams as well.

2006	ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Many people had a hand in the completion of this thesis.
2006	Thank you to my thesis advisers Dr. Patricia Antrim, Dr. Jennifer Robins, and, most especially, Dr. Odin Jurkowski, whose patience and guidance were invaluable.
2006	Each brought a diverse but equally important area of expertise to the process which made for a much more thorough and well-grounded research project.
2006	Thanks also to my children, Joel and Conor, who gave up a good portion of their computer time to their mother when she needed it.
2006	Finally, a special thanks to my husband Robin for his computer expertise and sensible perspective which helped keep the survey from getting beyond me.

2006	I would also like to thank Dr. Keith Curry Lance for all of his work in the field of Library Science and for his many studies over the years to inspire librarians like myself.
2006	I would like to express thanks to Dr. Mike Lufner for his assistance with all of �that statistical stuff.� I was so fortunate to learn from your expertise.
2006	Thank you to my group of proofreaders, Mary Sutton, Cindy Smith, and Barbara O�Malley, for serving as excellent editors.
2006	I greatly valued your opinions and advice.
2006	Thank you to my family for all of your understanding and patience.
2006	You all have been so wonderful and supportive.
2006	And lastly, appreciation goes to my library supervisor, Laurie Butler, and fellow librarians of Shelby County Schools, for all of your support, assistance, and helpful information.

2007	Thank you to the librarians at Michigan State University, University of Illinois, Indiana University Libraries, Enoch Pratt Free Library, and the Arizona State Library who have answered my questions and patiently retrieved sources for me to use.
2007	A special thanks goes out from me to Danny Callison, Katy Hartman McCrea, and Charlotte Ford, who have mentored and encouraged me, most frequently by telling me to �just get it done.� Beth Duley�s unflagging support and editorial advice have helped me make this study better.
2007	Never once did her eyes glaze over (completely) during the endless conversations I initiated about librarians and comics.
2007	She even seemed to enjoy the random tidbits I tossed out from whatever I happened to be reading To my friends, Steve Vitosky and Mary Margaret Bowles; my brother, Ralph Steven Tilley; and my father, Ralph Wallace Tilley: I wish you could celebrate the completion of this work with me, but I know you are cheering me on from wherever you are watching me.
2007	v  [W]e have reached the conclusion that comic books are misleading, represent stereotyping of all kinds, have the wrong general atmosphere, poor taste.
2007	Probably no comic book�because to me there is no �better� comic book�has any place in a library or school.
2007	Probably authored by Frances Henne, 1950 Children read comics and they even bring them into the library, though with a rather shame-faced look which disappears as soon as they see I have no objections.
2007	I still enjoy an occasional Bugs Bunny or Donald Duck myself, and turn the tables on the children by borrowing their books.
2007	Mary Farr Hill, Library Assistant, 1950 No one who has not spent a whole sunny afternoon under his bed rereading a pile of comics left over from the previous holidays has any real idea of the meaning of intellectual freedom.

2008	I have been fortunate that many experiences in my life have guided me to insights that I have made during this project.
2008	My studies of American business history and my MPA helped give me the needed background in budgeting, marketing, management, and agenda setting In addition, after some of the interviews had taken place I recognized how aspects of diplomacy, which years ago I had a number of courses about, were analogous to some of the behind-the-scenes aspects of academia's budgeting process Furthermore, while working at the National Hockey League I learned two lessons 1) that for some employers politics is more important than the how dedicated you are to your job or how well you do it, and 2) the truth of the old ice hockey saying that it must be a great sport to have survived its league's management Cooper Last of the Mohicans,!

2008	Furthermore, I thank those dozens of other libraries that allowed me to use their materials via interlibrary loan.
2008	I also thank my supervisor, Gwen Arthur, for allowing me to use my vacation time when I needed to work on this project.
2008	Of particular assistance, and what was the genesis of my research, was the dissertation of Douglas Birdsall, may he rest in peace.
2008	I was already considering the study of library budgets when in a class Peter Hernon mentioned Birdsall's prior study.
2008	It was this brief reference that led to me taking up my line of research.
2008	Other Simmons faculty played critical roles in my attainment of a doctorate.
2008	First, I am thankful for the excellent training that I have received in my classes, both at Simmons College and elsewhere.
2008	Furthermore, my doctoral committee, which, in addition to my advisor, was made up of Gerry Benoit, Michele Cloonan, Amy Pattee, Candy Schwartz, and Rong Tang, provided me with very helpful advice.
2008	In addition, I greatly appreciate the fellowship that the program awarded to me.
2008	Obviously, the most important individual for me at Simmons was my advisor, Pat Oyler.
2008	She spent untold hours and provided countless suggestions about how to improve this work.
2008	I give her a tremendous amount of thanks.
2008	ACKNOWLEDGMENTS An effort such as this one cannot be realized without the support of many individuals.
2008	First and foremost, I gratefully acknowledge the contribution of 28 professionals who participated in this study.
2008	Of necessity, those individuals who have allowed me to access to their working lives and graciously shared their stories, must remain anonymous.
2008	But a sincere word of thanks must be extended to them, for their time and unselfish cooperation.
2008	This dissertation is, in part, the result of their efforts, too.
2008	I owe a substantial intellectual debt to many scholars at McGill University.
2008	I would like to first extend my deepest gratitude to Dr. France Bouthillier, my advisor who led me into the world of competitive intelligence.
2008	Her wisdom, expert advice, and constant encouragement have helped me through many tough moments, from the conception of this study to its completion.

2008	I would like to thank my advisory committee members, Dr. Andrew Large, Dr. Jamshid Beheshti, and Dr. Charles Lusthaus.
2008	Their constructive comments and insightful opinions, as well as good humour, were always a joy to behold.

2008	My special thanks go to my parents and sisters.
2008	Throughout this long, "roller coaster" journey, they have been a constant source of inspiration, strength, and emotional support.
2008	Particularly, I thank my sister, Ying, for her love and superb support.
2008	To some of my lifelong buddies, Kwan Yi, Ping Li, Xiaowen Bao, Charles-Antoine Julien, Nahid Tabatabaei, Yang Lin, Wu Chang, and Hao Tian, I shall always be grateful for their encouragement, confidence, generosity, and true friendship.
2008	Also, I thank Julie Vovan for her help on the French language.
2008	Finally, I salute the patience and support of my wife, Die, who for many years has endured a husband frequently preoccupied with his work.
2008	To support me through this ordeal, she has sacrificed many things.
2008	Over the passage of time, we have experienced so much distress and happiness together.
2008	I appreciate those unyielding hugs that she has given me, and I sincerely acknowledge her love, unselfishness, and belief in me.

2008	I got direction, guidance, encouragement and support at every step from a large number of people.
2008	It is my pleasure to acknowledge that and thank everyone who helped me to complete this journey.
2008	First I would like to thank all my committee members: Professor Michael Twidale, Committee Chair; Professor ChengXiang Zhai, Director of Research; Professor Linda Smith and Professor Bryan Heidorn.
2008	My committee is an outstanding and dream committee.
2008	I thank my committee members for everything from the bottom of my heart.
2008	It is my honor to have Professor ChengXiang Zhai not only on my committee but also as my Dissertation Director.

2008	He was very excited about it and gave direction to explore.
2008	He encouraged me to join his research team.
2008	The association with his team, especially with Qiaozhu Mei and presentation of my early findings in the weekly group research forum helped me to move ahead in my work.
2008	I believe that without his enthusiasm, inspiration, guidance and support at every step right from the idea to the final work, I would not have been able to do this thesis work on the topic in which I was very interested.
2008	I would always be proud of having Professor Zhai as the Dissertation Direction and he would always be my source of inspiration for my v   future endeavors.
2008	"Without inspiration the best powers of the mind remain dormant, there is a fuel in us which needs to be ignited with sparks" (Johann Gottfried Von Herder).

2008	Her kind support and 'always there to help' motivated me a lot.
2008	She was my mentor during times of crisis and moments of frustrations.
2008	Her motivation and encouragement was a key in the whole journey of the PhD program.
2008	I would like to convey my special thanks to her for being Co-PI on this project and providing logistics support to me when I was away from the campus and I strongly believe without her help and assistance it would have not been vi   possible to reach the finishing line of this journey.
2008	She has been and always would be my source for empathy, patience, hard work and epitome of kindness.
2008	To me she has been a very special person and would always remain.
2008	"When I started counting my blessings, my whole life turned around'' (Willie Nelson) I am very grateful to Professor Michael Twidale, the Chair of the Committee and my academic advisor for his valuable guidance through out my program of study.
2008	Without his guidance, encouragement and great ideas, it would not have been possible to finish not only this thesis work but also the PhD program.
2008	I believe Professor Twidale has this supernatural vision on the potential of work that is unparalleled.
2008	His, this vision led me to the email goldmine in the help desk.
2008	I am a firm believer of his philosophy of testing the concept on a small dataset and then setting on the big journey.

2008	Professor Twidale has outstanding ability to power his students with enthusiasm and this is one of the things that I would miss when I graduate from this place.
2008	I am very thankful to him for support, motivation and guidance at every stage of the degree program.

2008	Dr. Wolske gave extraordinary support to me in this work.
2008	He agreed to be the Principal Investigator (PI) for this work and gave the credence to this work.
2008	Without his zeal and generous support, the research on the help desk emails would have been a very long and arduous journey.
2008	I hope the results from this thesis can help in fulfilling your vision of the help desk at GSLIS.
2008	His guidance not only on this research but also in teaching (as his TA) would be remembered always.
2008	Thanks a lot Dr. Wolske for everything.

2008	Acknowledgements
2008	ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This dissertation is the product of much hard work over the course of many days merging into nights and vice versa.
2008	I am forever grateful for the prayers, words of encouragement, and support of every kind received from friends, colleagues, and complete strangers during this intellectual journey.
2008	The names of all these persons are too numerous to mention here.
2008	However, I would be remiss not to acknowledge my deepest appreciation for the contributions archivists in North Carolina and from across the nation made to this study.
2008	I thank each of them for taking time out of their busy schedules to talk with me, participate in interviews, and recommend other archivists and repositories for my consideration.
2008	I especially thank the members of my advisory committee for their patience and support.
2008	Last, but certainly not least, I thank my husband, Lewis Church, for burning the late-night oil with me and keeping me company when it seemed all the rest of the world engaged in quiet slumber.

2008	without consideration of ongoing technical support, repair and maintenance, training of teachers or curriculum reforms.
2008	The mere presence of a device provided a very narrow measurable sense of access (or potential access), rather than a wider sense of effective use of the access (p. 32).
2008	Effective use of access had not been defined or measured.
2008	Similarly, assessing technology through the presence of infrastructure conduits and available hardware devices may have provided information on whether the infrastructure was in place to support devices, and whether fees were paid that allow access to content, but also did not assess actual access to information (Warschauer, 2004).
2008	This acknowledgement of the lack of earlier methods in assessing digital access supported the refined view of the information divide as a complex matter and supported the current view of the overwhelming need for the development information and technology literacy for economic and educational success (Warschauer, 2004).
2008	ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
2008	ACKNOWLEDGEMENT During the many years it has taken me to advance to this stage of my academic program, anything could have happened.

2008	ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS I have anguished somewhat over how to write my acknowledgements.
2008	An adequate job would occupy too many pages to include, for the people who have helped me along the way are too numerous to list.
2008	A few highlights�inexcusably brief�will have to suffice.
2008	First, my family adjusted their lives for years and years so that I could be a student.
2008	Mom, Dad, Amy, Dale, Colleen, Aaron, Jonathan: my ability with words fails me.
2008	Perhaps there are no words for the gratitude I owe you.
2008	I love you all.
2008	Ralph Enlow cleared the path for me to begin my Ph.D. work during his provost days at Columbia International University.
2008	Ralph, you are the most brilliant higher education administrator to set foot in contemporary academe.
2008	This, melded with your impeccable integrity and your drive to see others succeed under your leadership has made you one of the most positive influences in the hearts and minds of people at all levels and in many places, including mine.
2008	Your enduring friendship is a treasure in my life.
2008	My interview participants gave me the gift of "rich, thick data" that I needed for transcript analysis.

2008	Your patience when I was distracted and your sincere expressions of interest in my project gave me a daily boost.
2008	iv   Through it all, the Reverend Paul Sizemore and the congregation of Mount Olive Lutheran Church in Irmo, South Carolina, reminded me week after week what the love of God looks like in word and deed.
2008	You kept me alert to the context of meaning for life.
2008	May God's grace abound to you without measure!
2008	Finally, my dissertation committee and the EDLP faculty in the College of Education at the University of South Carolina brought me to a level of intellectual maturity I never thought possible.
2008	I am in awe at how you demonstrate the deep compatibility of high scholarship and classroom teaching.
2008	Michelle Maher, you exhibited the seven habits of highly effective dissertation committee chairs: classroom excellence, scholarly accomplishment, personal connectedness with the dissertation writer, strong interaction with the dissertation text, the ability to guide without steering, tactful navigation of committee dynamics, and of course fast replies to email!
2008	Katherine Chaddock, your command of the professional literature and your ability to cite from memory sheds a beam of insight on every discussion.

2008	ACKNOWLEDGMENTS In July of 1999 I sat waiting for an appointment to speak with Dr. Karen Card about beginning the Ed.D.
2008	program at the University of South Dakota.
2008	In Dr. Card's office was a very happy student who was turning in the final copy of her dissertation.
2008	At that time, I was hoping that some day that person might be me.
2008	Now, nine years later, I am graduating.
2008	This is a very happy and fulfilling moment for me and a moment for which I owe Dr. Card a tremendous heartfelt thank you.
2008	Dr. Card's interest, ideas, and encouragement throughout the dissertation process helped me succeed at this demanding intellectual task and has, hopefully, assisted me in producing a document that will have a positive impact on the profession of academic librarianship.
2008	I also would like to thank Dr. Mark Baron for his outstanding teaching skills and sense of humor.
2008	While I was taking a research methods course with Dr. Baron, I realized that he was outlining my dissertation for me.
2008	While he was unaware of this, I saw my entire dissertation project coming together.
2008	While no dissertation is an easy project, mine was far easier after taking Dr. Baron's class.
2008	I would also like to thank Dr. Baron for the diligence with which he reviewed my dissertation.
2008	It is a much cleaner document because of his efforts.
2008	Dr. Larry Bright deserves a special thank you for everything that he invests in his students.
2008	Dr.
2008	Bright conducts his classes in an executive seminar style and, by doing so, creates a learning environment in which students learn from one another.
2008	Dr.
2008	Bright's classroom style helped me to learn from the vi   experiences of my classmates and helped me to appreciate the richness of their experiences.
2008	As a result, I was honored by Dr.
2008	Bright's presence on my committee because he brought his own experiences in higher education into my endeavors which resulted in my dissertation being more philosophical than it otherwise might have been.
2008	I also owe a very special thank you to my colleague, Dr. Margaret Miller, of the University of South Dakota I. D. Weeks Library.
2008	While I worked with Dr. Miller at the I. D. Weeks Library from 1997 to 2000, she was always professional and enthusiastic.
2008	Dr. Miller brought her vast knowledge of the issues related to faculty status as it relates to academic librarians to my committee.
2008	As a result, she reviewed my research in a rigorous manner and in doing so ensured its quality.
2008	I would also like to thank my mother, Nelda, and sister, Pamela.
2008	As an individual with a disability that has an impact on everything I do in life, I occasionally face some very dark days.
2008	In January and February of 2007,1 faced some of the darkest of all.
2008	Fortunately, with the love and encouragement of my mother and sister, I was able to overcome these dark days and continue toward the completion of my degree.
2008	I thank them both so very much.
2008	Finally, I would like to thank God, whose grace is sufficient for me.

2009	Acknowledgments
2009	ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This dissertation could not have happened without tremendous support from many individuals.
2009	First, I would like to thank my advisor, Professor Margaret L. Hedstrom.
2009	My greatest achievement through the Ph.D. program is the change from a narrow-minded librarian whose thoughts were dominated by intuition and emotion to a researcher with analytical and strategic thinking skills.
2009	This change was not possible without the support from my advisor.
2009	Instead of insisting that I stay in the traditional archive field, Margaret allowed me to swim in theories and methodologies from other fields by taking courses about mathematic modeling, rational choice and game theory.
2009	Also very importantly, she warned me not to stray too far away and told me when it was time to start a dissertation.
2009	She showed great patience and tolerance in reading my various drafts, gave insightful instructions and guided me step by step toward the end of this journey.
2009	Her generous funding support freed me from a teaching load and made it possible for me to focus on research.
2009	Professor Myron P. Gutmann, as the director of the Interuniversity Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR) and a professor with teaching load, was willing to meet me several times to help me develop my dissertation proposal and gave very detailed instructions in presenting the results from this study.
2009	As an expert in the data curation field, his comments and suggestions were tremendously helpful, especially in thinking about why I needed to do this research, and how useful it is for the data curation field.
2009	Professor Paul N. Courant was very insightful in pointing out the most critical problem in my research.
2009	He guided me to think about how my research could be useful for policy makers, and how to extend my research to the secondary use of self-collected data.
2009	Professor Ixchel Faniel provided very detailed instructions in creating measurements for some constructs and in organizing and structuring the dissertation.
2009	Her comments on the first draft of this dissertation were very constructive, covering both big picture problems and very small details.
2009	Professor Ann Zimmerman was very helpful to iii   me, not only because her dissertation and publications are part of the foundation of my research, but also because she was always willing to chat with me about my ideas and give suggestions.
2009	I would like to thank the funders of this research.
2009	They are the NSF Award # IIS 0456022, Rackham Research Grant for Dissertation and One-term Dissertation Writing A ward.
2009	Thanks very much for the School of Information doctoral committee for nominating me for the One-term Dissertation Writing Award.
2009	Without this award, I would not have graduated until one semester later.
2009	I am very grateful to numerous interviewees and survey respondents, especially interviewees who spent about one hour answering questions with great patience.
2009	I thank statisticians at the Center for Statistical Consultation and Research (CSCAR) for their assistance in data analysis.
2009	I thank data archivists from ICPSR for their support in conducting related studies that motivated my dissertation research.
2009	I also wish to thank the staff at the School of Information, particularly Sue Schuon, Jocelyn Webber and Christine Eccleston for their long-time administrative support.
2009	I am very grateful to Beth St. Jean, Ricardo L. Punzalan, Kim Yong-mi, Maria Souden, Morgan Daniels and Xingxing Yao for their instructions in English writing, comments on my paper drafts, and help with developing my presentation skills.
2009	I thank my friends and numerous nice people I met at Ann Arbor.
2009	They brought me an enjoyable time and taught me important knowledge about life.
2009	I greatly appreciate the sacrifice my parents made for my education.
2009	I thank my parents-in-law for their love and care.
2009	Finally and most importantly, I was quite fortunate to have a husband, Linhong Chen, who is also my best friend, a private tutor and advisor.
2009	He encouraged me to start the Ph.D. study, pulled me through the most difficult time during the first 3-4 years, and took care of every aspect of my life.

2009	PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE
2009	Acknowledgements
2009	ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
2009	ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS As with any work involving so substantial a commitment of time and effort, there are many people who have contributed greatly to the completion of this dissertation and who deserve recognition for their willingness to assist, understand, support, and endure.
2009	While I extend my gratitude to each and every person who in some way helped with the completion of this project, I also appreciate the certainty that many contributors will remain, unfortunately, unnamed.
2009	To those people I will thank directly, my only regret is that I can never repay your kindness and patience more adequately.
2009	The best I can do is a sincere thank you.
2009	First, I extend my deepest gratitude to Dr. Kathy G. Short, advisor, colleague, and mentor.
2009	From her I learned the value of reading for myself and being able to trust my interpretations.
2009	From the first day I bounded into her office unannounced, Dr. Short has used her considerable intelligence, intuition, and patience to guide me (sometimes lovingly push me) to work harder than I ever imagined I could.
2009	Without her hard work and her willingness to be there, this project most certainly would most certainly never have reached fruition.
2009	I offer my thanks, my respect, and my promise to continue to uphold her vision about what teaching and learning should and can be.
2009	Second, I wish to acknowledge the dedication and assistance of the other members of my dissertation committee: Dr. Chris Iddings, Dr. Leisy Wyman, and Dr. David Yaden, Jr. From each I learned.
2009	Their willingness to guide, to share, to listen, and to criticize was a collective gift that I shall never forget.
2009	Without their support, their wisdom, and their experience, I would never have attained my goal.
2009	I also wish to thank my many colleagues for their aid and for their continuing commitment to education.
2009	I especially want to thank Dr. Mary DeBey who first told me, �Go get a doctorate!� Through her mentorship at and beyond Bennington College I was able to learn how to be dogged and tenacious in the midst of a complicated life.
2009	She is and will continue to be my role model in scholarship and in life.
2009	Again, thank you Dr. DeBey.
2009	To my Mum, Susan Sklar Payne, I cannot say enough.
2009	Thank you for reading to me every night.
2009	You have been a true friend and mother, even when the job may have been less than pleasant.
2009	Thanks for sticking by me and loving me unconditionally.
2009	To my friend and co-parent, Michael, grazie.
2009	Thank you for continuing to be my champion for the past twenty years.
2009	When I was stuck, you always said that you believed in me and everything would work out.
2009	Thank you for your optimism and friendship.
2009	To Kevin Vinson, colleague, friend, and husband.
2009	Thank you for the last minute philosophy tutorials, the endless ice coffees, and your loving, critical, and intelligent support.
2009	It is a lucky thing indeed to have a spouse who can discuss the ins and outs of Dewey while doing the laundry.
2009	Lastly, to Miriam, my daughter.
2009	For her patience, support, and insightful readings of children�s literature.
2009	Thank you for our last eleven years of bedtime stories.
2009	I offer you, Miriam, my love, my gratitude, and the long awaited statement, �The thing has been written!� I dedicate this to my daughter, Miriam.

2009	ACKNOWLEDGEMENT Pursuing my doctoral study at the School of Library and Information Studies (SLIS), University of Wisconsin-Madison, has been an intellectually stimulating and rewarding experience.
2009	I would like to thank all the faculty, staff, and students at SLIS.
2009	Their very presence and endeavors have made SLIS a warm and resourceful community that fosters intellectual and personal growth.
2009	I would especially like to express my gratitude to the faculty members on my dissertation committee.
2009	I am most grateful to my committee chair and marvelous mentor, Dr. Kyung-Sun Kim, who has graciously shared her expertise, insights and time with me.
2009	She is always open to discussions of different perspectives and research methods, and has a keen eye for important matters.
2009	Dr. Kim inspires an appreciation of vigorous research, intellectual curiosity, and genuine care and concern for others; she has been very instrumental in my growth as an independent researcher and instructor.
2009	Without her continuous support, my dissertation research and time as a doctoral student would not have been as fruitful.
2009	My committee members are similarly generous with their time and counsel.
2009	I would like to thank them here: Dr. Louise Robbins, who inspires me with her work on, and commitment to, equality and diversity; Dr. Christine Pawley, who offers insightful perspectives and has helped broaden my research horizons; Dr. Ethelene Whitmire, for sharing her mastery of the Education and LIS subject areas and of large-scale survey research; and, last but not least, Dr. Se-Kang Kim, who is a great source of guidance with his expertise in statistics.
2009	I feel privileged, and am very thankful, to have such wonderful mentors.
2009	11   Thanks also go to my colleagues and friends at SLIS's doctoral program, especially Chi-Shiou Lin, Sook Lim, Eun-Young Yoo, Soojin Park, Xiaohua (Awa) Zhu, Phoebe M. Chiu, Jom Polparsi, and Erin Meyer.
2009	The good times of doctoral life would not have been as much fun, and the tougher times not nearly as bearable, had they not been shared with amazing friends like these.
2009	I am also greatly appreciative of my family and friends.
2009	My parents and my elder sister, Susanna Sin, have been unwaveringly supportive of me and my studies.
2009	My aunts and uncles are a wellspring of support for me and my family, for which I am most thankful.
2009	The camaraderie and kindness of my friends have also been a balm throughout my sometimes hectic student life.
2009	Knowing that they are only a phone call (or instant message) away makes it so much easier to soldier on.
2009	Finally, I would like to acknowledge the data provided by the National Center for Education Statistics and the Census Bureau.
2009	Without their nationwide longitudinal data collection efforts, large-scale research such as this would not have been as feasible.
2009	ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Not a day went by during the first several years of this program that I didn't secretly feel like an interloper in the rarified profession of doctoral student.
2009	Each day I would think, "What makes you think you can do this?
2009	No one else in your family has done this�I don't think you will make it."
2009	Starting a program with an almost full-time job, a five-year old to take care of, and almost a decade older than the next nearest in age in your cohort can lead to some serious self-doubts.
2009	Without the guidance, mentoring, and support of a great many people, this dissertation would not be finished, and I would not have earned my Ph.D.
2009	I would like to acknowledge the kindness and mentoring of Dr. Deborah Carter, my advisor and dissertation chair, and chair of the Center for the Study of Higher and Postsecondary Education.
2009	Your example ofjuggling a hundred balls in the air at once, while maintaining a steady keel, and a great sense of humor, provides daily inspiration to your many advisees.
2009	I would also like to thank John Burkhardt.
2009	Without John's guidance, I would not have had the courage to reapply for entry the program.
2009	I want to thank Sylvia Hurtado, who believed in my potential.
2009	I would also like to acknowledge and thank Jana Nidiffer, who was my first advisor and made it possible for me to juggle a great many responsibilities, and taught me how to analyze qualitative data, how to be an engaged iii   teacher and advisor, and truly cares about my success.
2009	Thank you for all your advice, editing, expertise, and friendship!
2009	Additionally, I would like to thank Janet Lawrence, Lester Monts and Barbara MacAdam who served on my dissertation committee and had the best for me in mind when guiding me throughout the dissertation process.
2009	Your perspectives were each very enriching to me, and have made this dissertation so much stronger.
2009	I would also like to thank Barbara MacAdam for her support, flexibility and encouragement (and taking all my reference hours while I was taking the qualifying exam!)
2009	throughout this degree process.
2009	You are a role model, mentor, and true friend.
2009	I want to acknowledge Olivia Frost at the School of Information for encouraging me to pursue the Ph.D.
2009	Thanks to Carla Stoffle for supporting me through this process, and putting me on to the micro aggressions literature.
2009	Thanks to the fabulous Interlibrary Loan department at the Hatcher Graduate Library for finding and loaning items quickly (and always graciously).
2009	And a special thanks to all my colleagues at the Hatcher Graduate Library Reference Department for filling in for me at crunch/emergency times, encouraging me, and cheering me on!
2009	iv
2009	Special thanks to the members of the Accountability Group who welcomed me with great warmth and respect, and to the Library Director, for inviting me in to the organization.
2009	Thanks also to the administrators from other organizations who enthusiastically volunteered their groups to participate.
2009	Your commitment to research is much appreciated.

2009	Acknowledgments
2009	ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS My gratitude is due first and foremost to my wife, Karen, whose love has sustained my efforts, and whose rigor has forced me again and again to redouble my efforts.
2009	My gratitude, along with an apology, goes also to my children, who have been very understanding when they want to play but "Daddy is writing."
2009	I owe a particular thanks to all those who have helped me in terms of my research and in the development of my argument.
2009	Here I owe a great debt to my thesis committee chair, Debbie Hansen, whose excitement about this project did more for my work than she will ever know.
2009	I would also like to thank, in this regard, the many scholars interested in the strange connection between Mormonism and Continental (and post- Continental) philosophy, variously associated with the LDS-Hermeneutics e-mail list, the Mormon Theology Seminar, and Mormon Scholars in the Humanities.
2009	Constant discussion with many of these scholars has been a principal resource for much of my thinking.
2009	In particular, I would like to thank Jim Faulconer, who arguably started me down this road when he introduced me to the work of Paul Ricoeur in 2004.
2009	Finally, I would like to thank my mother, whose exemplary steadiness has been a strength for me throughout this project; my wife's parents, whose material support and encouragement have been infinitely vital to my work; and Phil and Lynn Jarvis, who allowed me to borrow their home for a week of seclusion when it came time to put all of my research into a readable piece of writing.

2009	Acknowledgments
2009	ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
2009	ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Though the topic of this thesis began to take shape in my mind in 2002 as part of a post-doctoral research project on Decadence and American Modernism, it would not have taken its current form without the intellectual journey that began with my enrolment in the library and information studies program at the University of Alberta.
2009	I am indebted to a number of people who supported me as I weaved a rather erratic and circuitous route through this program.
2009	Darlene Syrotuik, former SLIS assistant director, was encouraging and enthusiastic when I first expressed interest in applying to the program.
2009	Also, as my aerobics instructor for eight years, she has also kept me fit through two graduate degrees.
2009	Alvin Schrader and Margaret Mackey were extremely accommodating and generous with their time, enabling me to pursue my own book history interests by supervising me in two directed study courses.
2009	My work for Margaret in a directed study on �The History of the Book in America� represented the genesis of this thesis.
2009	Joan Greer, of the Department of Art and Design, generously agreed to sit on my committee and has provided an important visual culture context for my project.
2009	My thanks are also due to SLIS administrative staff, especially Joanne Hilger, former SLIS Student Services Administrator, who was so helpful in negotiating my way into and out of and into the program.
2009	Ann Curry, Margaret Mackey, and Toni Samek came through for me in a particularly dramatic moment in my academic trajectory, providing me with the impetus needed to complete the program and the inspiration to write a thesis.
2009	I must also acknowledge those agencies and institutions that have supported my work: The Canadian Library Association, the Alberta Scholarship program, the Library Association of Alberta, the University of Alberta, and Rare Book School (Charlottesville), offered financial support, while the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada allowed me to finish my MLIS degree while holding a SSHRC Standard Research Grant.
2009	Finally, thanks to my husband, Gary Kelly, whose enthusiasm for my work is almost as strong as my own, and whose insight is, frankly, invaluable.
2009	ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS �On and on we go with copyright!�1 The title of this dissertation comes from a letter Stephen McCarthy (Executive Director of the Association of Research Libraries) wrote to Basil Stuart- Stubbs (Director of Libraries at the University of British Columbia) thanking him for a copy of a report prepared by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) to be considered at the Inter-Governmental Copyright Committee of the Universal Copyright Convention (UCC) in Paris in December 1973.
2009	By this time McCarthy had been personally involved with copyright revision for at least a decade.
2009	The revision process itself had been making fitful progress for eighteen years.
2009	McCarthy was just one year away from retirement and, although no one knew it in December 1973, the legislation was less than three years away from enactment.
2009	McCarthy�s lament expresses what many participants in the revision process must have felt at the seemingly unending process.
2009	I know that I, and I am sure my family, my teachers, and colleagues, have also quietly whispered this same phrase during the many years it has taken me to complete this work.
2009	The least I can do is thank my partner, Bethany, and son, Sam, the members of my dissertation 1 "Stephen A. McCarthy to Basil Stuart-Stubbs [December 18, 1973]," in Records of the Association of Research Libraries, Unprocessed materials #18,632 Box 9 of 64 Folder Copyright � Working Group on Reprographic Reproduction 1972/1973, Manuscript Division, Library of Congress.
2009	ix  committee, Professors Richard Cox, Michael Madison, and Rush Miller, and particularly Professor Toni Carbo who kept me on track and was unfailingly interested in my work, rigorous about the quality of the project, and a stickler for grammar and deadlines.
2009	I want to thank all my colleagues at the University of Pittsburgh University Library System and the Olin Library at Rollins College, and Provost Roger Casey for his support and encouragement during the writing process.
2009	Amy Knapp, Assistant University Librarian at the University of Pittsburgh tragically died far too young while I was writing this dissertation.
2009	She encouraged me to begin the PhD program, was always supportive, and is greatly missed.
2009	Finally, I want to thank two special professional colleagues, Barbara Bair, Historian/Manuscript Specialist, of the Manuscript Division at the Library of Congress and Rich Gause, Government Documents Librarian at the University of Central Florida.
2009	Both went to great lengths to help me access the government documents and archival resources I needed to complete this work.
2009	My archival research was supported in part by a Critchfield grant from Rollins College.
2009	This research would have been far easier if a complete finding aid existed for the ARL records at the Library of Congress.
2009	If the Association, or a benefactor, could be persuaded to undertake the creation of such a document I am sure more research would be undertaken on the history of the ARL.
2009	It is ironic, if all too common in librarianship, that an association so concerned with research and the organization and description of information has not made greater efforts to describe and provide intellectual access to its own history.
2009	In the 1950�s my mother was told by a fortuneteller that she would have a son who would become a doctor.
2009	Since none of her children entered the medical field, for many decades my mother thought the fortuneteller was a charlatan, but now it seems perhaps she was not.

2009	ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS When I left Korea in 2002 for study, I was exhausted and somewhat desperate.
2009	I could not understand what was wrong.
2009	Though many of my colleagues had dedicated themselves to progressive social movements for two decades since the dark age of Korea in the early 1980s, the healthy and happy world of which we had dreamed seemed still far away.
2009	Despite the toils and sacrifice of many people, new dominant power appeared and took the benefits of the democratization movement while human rights and economic justice we aspired to achieve seemed forever poised in some distant, unknowable future.
2009	My studies in the U.S. are a small step in long journeys for self-inquiry and for alternative ways to reach what we have dreamed of.
2009	It was my good fortune to meet with and learn from many knowledgeable and supportive scholars in the U.S.
2009	I am deeply grateful to my teachers, colleagues, and friends for inspiring me and providing me with invaluable support.
2009	Most of all, I offer my sincerest thanks to my advisor Professor John V. Pavlik for his unstinted encouragement and thoughtful direction.
2009	He was not just my academic advisor but a role model, demonstrating to me that good scholars should be good persons who can accept diverse opinions and willingly share their knowledge with anybody else.
2009	I also want to express my gratitude to my committee members, Professor Jack Bratich, Professor Susan Keith, and Professor Dong-hoo Lee for their insightful comments and advice.
2009	In addition, Professor Daniel O�Connor, Professor Bill Solomon, and Professor Montague Kern offered me endless support and guidance throughout my graduate years.
2009	I iv  would like to thank Joan Chabrak for her administrative support and Andrew Grossman for his critical review of my draft.
2009	I am indebted to my family and friends for their love and encouragement.
2009	My spiritual parents, Althira Romas and Tom Naumann, have prayed for me and enthusiastically supported me.
2009	My special thanks go to Bill Lee who encouraged me not to give up my dream.
2009	I sincerely thank my husband, Sunyu Moon, for being my lifelong fellow and critical reader of my study.
2009	I am also grateful to Kim Gisik, Kim Gibo, Ulcarman, Choi Sejin and many Korean activists and scholars who offered me their inspiring ideas and vivid experience.
2009	It is with sincere gratitude that I acknowledge the sustained support of my fellow doctoral students at Rutgers and, especially, those of us who bonded in a special Korean community.
2009	Also important to my development as a teacher was the guidance and supportive mentoring of Professor Young-mee Yu Cho.
2009	When my work brought me to the brink of mental and physical exhaustion, my five-year- old daughter told me, �Work harder and play a lot, then you will be happier.� She was right.
2009	I thank Sarah Moon for her amazing advice and encouragement.
2009	I hope I will be remembered by her as a woman who does not give up struggling for a better world.
2009	I send my kisses and hugs to her.

2009	I don't think it is important to locals I don't know about Malayslan but we get lots of foreign articles.
2009	Publishing online is very fast and I hke It because it is hke working using ISO.
2009	For example when you send articles you will get acknowledgement receipt within 3 days, and you'll know whether your article IS considered for the publication or not within a month.
2009	Usually this time frame is true and the reviewing, refereeing and editing all done online.
2009	They will send copies to you as an author to look at the edited versIOn.
2009	Every word or sentence or structure that has been edited they highlighted it somehow in colours.
2009	Then whether you accept or reject... that's wonderful I think that would be the future for people who want to publish in online.
2009	Many people in Malaysia are talking about content and development ofthe journals.
2009	We are not there yet.
2009	That's what we are lacking.
2009	I've presented my system to all scholarly journals but the question they are asking whether you're making money.
2009	To me academic journal never make money don't, blind yourself with making money we don't because our subSCribers very little.
2009	Unless, Dewan Bahasa others don't make money so, not all journal from abroad are making money.
2009	So why are we talking about this?
2009	I f we have the system and a lot o f academIC journals start parking there we will become rich because more viSIble and people will be attracted.
2009	One thing about EJUM is that even the journals are different the search engine is the same we have common search engine like some journals in Malaysia they use different search engine for different journals.
2009	You can specifY, that you want to search certain journal or all the journals we have.
2009	So the flexibility is there.
2009	Sometimes people have phobia and worned about plagiarism and loose the copyright.
2009	I think Malaysian should not worry about that unless you're dOing so important research like nuclear research or whatever.
2009	We said that it is easy for people to plagiaries ifthey go to hbrary and xerox (photocopy) the whole artIcle they are plagiarising also.
2009	It is back to square one, doesn't solve the problem at all to me the main issue for EJUM or any journal for that matter is I want it to be disseminated as far as possible to the user, and I want the user to retrieve just as fast so that i f there are articles that they can use in their research they can use it.
2009	The usage o f article in the journal will create more Impact for the article that I carry instead stays on the shelves and nobody used it.

2012	Mashal 18  Chapter 3: Indicators of Value for Rare Books From individual volumes to an entire collection, rare books will need to be appraised and/or valued at some point in time.
2012	Depending on the type of appraisal or valuation needed (insurance, donation, fair market valuation, or other) different values may be given and the recommended frequency of appraisal will vary.
2012	For the purposes of this study, it is necessary to understand how dealers price rare books for sale, and how auction estimates are established, before comparing those values to those given and achieved online.
2012	The prices set for books on the Internet appear to be more along the lines of the prices set by dealers, rather than an estimate range given at auction.
2012	There is a critical distinction to be made between auction estimates and dealer prices.
2012	Auction estimates provide a range that the specialist department deems to be appropriate based on a variety of factors.
2012	These estimates can be conservative or aggressive depending on the market, and there is always a chance that the hammer price could fall above or below the estimates.
2012	Dealers, on the other hand, place a definitive retail price on the book, also dependent on various factors.
2012	Though the prices and estimates set for books may differ, dealers and auction houses use the same grading system in                                                           system, according to multiple sources, first appeared in an issue of                    , and has become a sort of unofficial standard grading system among professionals in the 91 field.
2012	The various levels of this grading system are listed below:   As New   is to be used only when the book is in the same immaculate condition in which it was published.
2012	There can be no defects, no missing pages, no library stamps, etc., and the dust jacket (if it was issued with one) must be perfect without any tears.

2012	First editions are always the most desirable edition of a book.

2012	There are additional attributes that can be factored into the estimate, though these elements may not be present with every book.
2012	It was previously mentioned that with modern first editions, the inclusion of the dust jacket is a necessity.
2012	For many Victorian books, the inclusion of the dust jacket adds to a books rarity, especially,                                                                   ithout a second 106 105 that there are different levels of signatures and inscriptions, each of which with its own thought.

2012	Both Mr. Costanzo and Mr. Haley stated that it would be possible to fiddle with rare books and alter parts of them to make them appear to be more valuable.
2012	In discussing fakes and forgeries in the rare book world, Mr. Costanzo mentioned a few ways in which books can be slightly altered to increase value.
2012	One is for someone to take the title page of a destroyed first edition and place it with the text of a really good second edition, so as to make the second edition appear to be a first edition.
2012	Dust jackets can be taken from one book and placed on another, and while this is not considered to be a forgery, it is what professionals in 117                                              book is thought to have been altered with, such as when individual leaves are replaced with facsimiles.
2012	He and his colleagues look for signs of age with the paper and bindings to make sure that they are consistent with when the book was printed and bound.
2012	Any of these additions do affect the value of the book                                                   there are facsimile leaves or binding restorations, it basically affects the value in the same way as condition: a facsimile leaf is equivalent to a missing leaf, a deceptively good later binding is still                  118 .

2012	There is a trick, which Mr. Costanzo mentioned, to help with determining if a signature could be a fake: a forger will often fake an authors signature on a lesser grade, inexpensive copy of the book, rather than taking a chance of forging on an important copy and risk ruining it.
2012	Another thing specialists need to be aware of with signatures is the presence of secretarial signatures for certain authors.
2012	It is quite difficult to tell the difference between secretarial signatures and the authentic signatures for certain individuals.
2012	And while it is not considered to be a forged signature, it is considered by collectors to be less desirable than the authentic signature of the author.
2012	In determining the value of a book for sale at auction or through a dealer, each instance is different from the one before it.
2012	Depending on the object in question, different factors will play a role in contributing to the overall value.
2012	Also the basic laws of supply and demand as well as the overall atmosphere of the market must also be factored into the equation.
2012	Past prices achieved for comparable books do help in determining where a starting point for the value should be, but the final estimate is dependant on the specific attributes of the rare book.
2012	It is not an exact science, but like other areas of appraising, an appropriate estimate can be determined through research of previously achieved prices and experience with handling the objects to know what valuable attributes to look for.

2012	In addition to having access to all of that information, the auction preview allows for the books to be viewed in person.
2012	A prospective buyer or their agent can view and inspect the book prior to bidding, making sure that the condition reports reflect the state of the book.
2012	Specialists and other department staff are present during the auction exhibition as well, and can provide further information or answer any questions a prospective buyer may have.
2012	Auction prices are also a matter of public record, and as such a buyer can perform their own research of past sale prices to determine what they believe would be a fair price for the book before they bid.

2012	For some collectors though, the benefits of being able to see the book and access information prior to auction outweighs the additional fees that are                                                                                         amount varies depending on the terms of the consignment agreement.

2012	These online bids are incorporated into the sale by the auctioneer, the same way that a bid in the room or a phone bid would be.
2012	Even though the winning bid may be made via the online bidding, it can still be considered to be a component of the brick-and-mortar auction.
2012	Rare Book Dealers There are a great number of rare book dealers active in the United States and in                                                                                        Mashal 28  membership organizations in the field, providing a code of ethics and other benefits for members.

2012	A purchaser can also go to meet with the dealer to see the book in person, much like at an auction exhibition.
2012	Some of the larger rare book dealers will put together catalogues of their inventory or recent acquisitions and send that out to clients and collectors, but that is not done by all.
2012	Nor do all dealers have websites where they list their inventory and process sales.
2012	There are benefits for the purchaser when buying from a dealer, as opposed to at auction.
2012	These benefits all boil down to the relationship that is to be had between the collector and the dealers, something that is not always possible with auction houses.
2012	Depending on the depth of the relationships, a dealer could provide discounts to valuable customers, allow for priority viewings of important pieces, and assist with developing the                                                                                                 able to resolve any issues with the book arising after the purchase   a point brought up by many special collections librarians when discussing acquiring books from dealers.
2012	One issue with purchasing from a dealer is that a buyer may have to search for a bit before they find the book they are looking for.
2012	This could entail inquiring with multiple dealers to see if they have it in inventory, or waiting for one dealer to acquire the desired 121 Mid Atlantic Chapter ABAA, "Member Listing," accessed September 5, 2011, http://www.abaamidatlantic.org/cgi-bin/abaamac/index.html.

2012	The level of depth and accuracy of the condition described in the eBay listing also varies based upon the skill level, knowledge and experience of the seller.

2012	The ratings for booksellers on Alibris are listed with the search results also.
2012	The structure of the Alibris website is similar to that of AbeBooks in that The listings contain information on the seller (with location included), the price, standard bibliographic details, a description by the seller, and a field for condition.
2012	In the condition field, booksellers can input one of the standard condition levels for books (i.e.
2012	Very Good, Good, Fair, Poor)   though for some listings this field does not have information and instead refers the reader to the overall description.
2012	The condition field can prove helpful when going through the search results list to narrow down the available listings.
2012	Sellers can upload images to their listings, but sometimes the image is not of the specific book being discussed in the listing, and is instead a generic photograph of that book.
2012	Price Comparison Websites While price comparison websites were not a focus of the data research for this study, it is important to discuss their existence in the landscape of Internet book sales.
2012	Two well- known price comparison sites used by many are AddALL.com and Bookfinder.com.
2012	These sites compile into one mega-list the current listings for books on various book selling websites.
2012	Buyers can use this information to see what websites have copies of the book they 125 Alibris: Used Books, Used Textbooks, Rare & Out-of-Print Books, "The Alibris Story," accessed August 16, 2011, http://www.alibris.com/about/story.

2012	Sellers can use these price comparison websites to discover who their competition is with regards to a certain book, and learn the prices their competitors are listing for a certain book.
2012	The links compiled in the price comparisons will lead directly to the listing on a website like AbeBooks or Alibiris   no actual listings are posted directly on AddALL or Bookfinder.
2012	These main purpose of these websites is to assist with locating specific books in the vast marketplace for books on the Internet.
2012	The sellers on eBay, AbeBooks and Alibris all aim to sell rare books in an online market place.
2012	The major difference between eBay and AbeBooks or Alibris is the seller.
2012	Anyone can list a rare book for sale on eBay, but on AbeBooks or Alibris, a buyer is guaranteed that the seller is an independent bookseller who has experience in the book trade.
2012	Buyers can, and are sometimes encouraged in the listings, to contact the booksellers from AbeBooks or Alibris for further information and photographs of a book.
2012	This allows for the buyer to develop a level of trust and a relationship with the seller, making the process of buying over the Internet a bit less impersonal.
2012	For all of the convenience the Internet is supposed to provide for the seller and the buyer, one major element of the rare book trade does not transfer   the ability to personally examine a book before buying.
2012	For rare book collectors the object is everything, and being able to personally inspect the book guarantees that they are purchasing exactly what they want.
2012	Comparisons can be drawn to buying a book out of a dealer or auction catalogue without seeing it in person, however, in those cases more often than not, the book is inspected by someone (usually an agent) before the buyer finalizes the sale.
2012	With the Internet Mashal 33  sales, this is just not possible   the buyer sees the book in person only after payment has been made.
2012	The Internet marketplaces do not account for the highly personal elements that are inherent and highly valued within the rare book trade.
2012	What follows is a comparison and discussion of prices achieved for a selection of rare books sold at auction, through dealers, and the prices listed for rare books on eBay, AbeBooks and Alibris.
2012	Mashal 34  Chapter 5: Price Comparisons - Auction & Dealer Sales vs. Internet Sales and Listings The amount of available data for rare book sales is immense.
2012	For rare books sold by dealers, the standard record is                      , which is published about twice a year                                  both in the United States and in Europe.
2012	Currently there are 94 volumes printed and the books are organized by author and subdivided by title.

2012	This data is offered in print volumes and online, though the digital database requires a subscription for access.
2012	Both of these data sources provide descriptions and condition notes for the books in addition to the                    When combined with the sales information available for rare books on the internet, for example from eBay and the book aggregate sites, the amount of data becomes overwhelming, to say the least.
2012	In order to sort through it all and draw meaningful conclusions, the search was narrowed down to three major collecting categories within the                                                    : 19th Century Literature (which includes both American and English literature), Modern First Editions (focusing mainly on American                                                                                             chosen (for a total of 10) as representative of their respective category.
2012	In searching for sales by dealers and at auction for these books, the data was limited to first editions sold from 2006 to the present, as the first edition is the most valued copy of a rare book.
2012	Searches for first editions of these books were conducted on the various online auction and book aggregate Mashal 35  sites throughout August of 2011.
2012	The data was further limited to those books whose condition was described using the grading system discussed earlier in this thesis.
2012	So as to draw the clearest conclusions, each of the ten books will be discussed individually, comparing the dealer and auction data to the information gathered from the various Internet sits for each title.

2012	For many of the listings on ABE Books and Alibris, images Examining the Data It is important to note that the data discussed above is only a small selection of the available data for the overall rare book market.
2012	However, it illuminates some points that could apply to the market as a whole.
2012	Auction houses and dealers consistently sell the better quality copies of these first editions.
2012	The owners trust the reputations and expertise of the auctioneers and dealers to sell their property, and buyers can trust that they are getting quality copies with desirable attributes (such as authentic signatures), as is evidenced by the high sale prices.
2012	For the books in this selection, auction houses or dealers sold very few (if any) mediocre or poor copies.
2012	Based on the searches done for this study, it appears that the majority of books that are being sold on these online venues, be it an auction site such as eBay or the book aggregate sites, are of mediocre quality.
2012	While a few books in poor condition were found to be listed, their condition was reflected in the nominal price.
2012	The very good copies and the signed copies that were found to be listed online had prices that seemed to be consistent with similar copies being sold by dealers or at auctions.
2012	As many dealers have started to list books on the book aggregate sites, the prices for books on AbeBooks and Alibris tend to be appropriate with regards to the books condition and other attributes (edition, signatures, etc.).

2012	That being said, there are also inexperienced book sellers who list on these websites, and the descriptions and prices cannot always be trusted to be accurate.
2012	It is interesting that for many of these online sales listings images were lacking for the book being offered.
2012	Some listings offered images upon request, but many simply did not list anything except the written description (which was also sometimes lacking) and the price.
2012	When buying at auction or through a dealer, a prospective buyer is able to see and handle the book in person.

2012	Mashal 54  Conclusions The Internet has become a standard within our every day life, and as such, it makes sense that the Internet would become a part of the business process for the rare book market.
2012	The role of the Internet within this market is likely to continue to grow and expand as a parallel sales venue to bookshops and auction houses.
2012	Auction house specialists Peter Costanzo and Matthew Haley commented on the growing role of the Internet with regards to the sales of rare books.
2012	Mr. Costanzo discussed that the Internet has affected the rarity for certain books as many copies can now be found online, and for some titles, the value has been lessened while for other titles the Internet has 263                                                                                            helped to increase value.

2012	Though, not all of the libraries consulted have purchased from online sites, they do make use of the various aggregate and price listing websites as a research tool.
2012	The private collectors interviewed each have had experiences, both good and bad, with purchasing books for their collections online.
2012	The common concern among the special collections libraries and collectors is with regards to trust in the seller, the description and the object itself.
2012	The data comparisons show that there are high value listings for certain titles on websites, but those prices may not be realized.
2012	The majority of prices on the Internet fall into what can be considered the middle range.
2012	Based on the data, brick-and-mortar auctions and dealers command consistent and higher prices - the main reason for this is most likely the 268 Ibid.

2012	The Internet has become a new sales venue in the rare book market, and it is not likely to disappear.
2012	It is also not likely that it will overtake the market share currently held by auction houses and dealers.
2012	The Internet lacks the key element of personal contact that is integral within the rare book market, and that is not something that can be recreated in the Internet matrix   at least not in the foreseeable future.
2012	There is also an issue with trusting descriptions and encountering amateur sellers.
2012	In order for the Internet sale to grow further and create a lasting presence in the market, stricter standards for sellers and listings should probably be drawn up and enforced.
2012	Perhaps if there are standards enforced in the future, the quality of the objects listed for sale online can be controlled and prices will be more consistent across the board.
2012	For now, the Internet has proved to be a useful purchasing and research tool for many, and has allowed auction houses and dealers to expand their business and their reach within the market.
2012	At this time, Internet sales of rare books does not appear to have a detrimental effect on the overall market; in fact, they have created a venue for the middle of the road books to be sold (i.e.
2012	those books that would not be sold at auction, yet are still not completely unsellable).
2012	As a parallel sales venue to auctions and dealers, the Internet is a successful tool; expanding to become a primary sales venue in addition to the existing ones will probably not work, due to the impersonal nature and skepticism inherent with buying sight unseen.
2012	Until standards are set and trust is built within the collector base, the Internet sales will continue to contribute positively to the rare book market, but the auction houses and dealers will remain as the main sellers of rare books.

2012	vi
2012	ACKNOWLEDGMENTS It has been said that doctoral work is solitary work.
2012	So much of what needs to be done is done alone.
2012	It is important to note that "alone" does not mean without help.
2012	I don't think I have ever relied on the help and support of others as much as I have during this process and I am truly thankful to the following: First and foremost, I'd like to recognize the amazing group of educators at Texas Woman's University who served on my doctoral committee.
2012	I am grateful for your feedback, support, guidance and encouragement through every step of this process.
2012	To Maria Cahill, Ph.D., thank you for your support and allowing me to work alongside you as your graduate assistant.
2012	To Lynn Akin, Ph.D. thank you for encouraging my love and advocacy of the publiclibrary.
2012	And most importantly, Sylvia Vardell, Ph.D. for sending me an email after my graduation from Library School in 2004 encouraging me to continue my education, and for your unwavering support of that decision over the past six years.
2012	Thanks also to the graduate school staff, especially Michan Chowritmootoo for your expert advice and infinite patience.
2012	I would also like to thank former TWU faculty, Dr. Janet Hilbun for your friendship and support, and fellow student Kimberly Kinnaird for being my comrade in arms.
2012	Special thanks go to Rose Brock for being my "lifeline," the one I call late at night to talk me down from the ledge and to my other super hearted friends Jill Bellomy and Libby Holtmann.
2012	Thank you all for listening... and for the pancakes.
2012	Almost everything I have ever learned about the history of the Newbery Award, came from the amazing K. T. Horning in her ALSC class, "Newbery, Past, Present and Future."
2012	Thank you for sharing your knowledge.
2012	This research is heavily based in cataloging which is not my specialty.
2012	Thanks to the following for sharing their knowledge and experience: Michal Ayers, MARC EDIT tutor and Technical Services Manager at the Irving Public Library; Helen Hughes, data miner and Technical Services supervisor at the Irving Public Library; and Shedrick Pittman-Hassett, Library Systems Administrator at North Central Texas College, friend and best second coder a girl could ask for.
2012	Thanks also go to my supervisors and co-workers at the Irving Public Library System for their patience and support during this process, especially, Chris Dobson, Karen Beckett, Patty Mount and eagle eyed Kristin Trevino.
2012	To my children, Madelaine, Freddy and Owen, thank you for understanding my mental absence and psychotic moments.
2012	I owe you many, many loads of clean laundry, home cooked meals and game nights.
2012	I promise I am good for it.
2012	And last, but not least, thank you to my best friend, loudest cheerleader, breathing coach and "the wearer of the rose-colored glasses:" Fred.
2012	What would I do without you?
2012	Certainly not this.

2012	I owe much gratitude to Dr. Moustapha Diack, my committee chairperson, who has guided me and encouraged me throughout this entire process.
2012	Many times, I am sure that Dr. Diack had more confidence in me than I had in myself.
2012	To him I cannot say �thank you� enough.
2012	I appreciate you, Dr. Diack.
2012	I would also like to thank my additional committee members: Dr. Joseph Meyinsse (always available; how do you do it?

2012	Margie and Kathy, I could not have made it without you!
2012	Thank you for always being there for me.
2012	iii  To my cousin Greg, the captain of my cheerleading squad, thank you.
2012	Without your sincere and encouraging words, and even sometimes nudging me into achieving my goal, there were many days I would have given up.
2012	But you kept on pushing me.
2012	I truly appreciate you Greg.
2012	To my aunts, uncles, nieces, and nephews, and to my remaining family and friends, who are just too many to name, thanks for all your support.
2012	God put you all in my life for a reason; for that I am so grateful.

2012	ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS In reflecting on the dissertation process over the past four years at Argosy University, Atlanta campus, I realize that the effort would not have been a successful one without the endearing support of so many individuals.
2012	Let me start by expressing my tremendous appreciation to my dissertation committee � Dr. Michael Tappler (Chair), Dr. Deloris Banks (Member), and Dr. Michelle Ramsey (Member).
2012	I owe each of them the deepest gratitude for their steadfast unrelenting support and for always being there when I needed advisement.
2012	I wish to express sincere gratitude especially to Dr. Tappler for his patience and expert guidance throughout my dissertation journey.
2012	I also would like to acknowledge Dr. Marian Anders and Dr. Murray Bradfield, who made sure I did not let the ball drop, but rather kept me always thinking about my writing to completion.
2012	I wish to express appreciation to Dr. Brenda Young, my first professor in the program, who started me on my way on the right foot.
2012	I must also acknowledge Mrs. Stacey Crain, a dedicated professional librarian, who served as an independent facilitator for the study.
2012	Let me not forget all those dear cohort peers, who dropped by on numerous occasions to share experiences � we all had stories to tell and laughed so many times to maintain our sense of humor.
2012	Finally, my sincerest gratitude to the entire Argosy family for providing such an unparalleled high quality and comprehensive Ed.D.
2012	program to equip me with the knowledge I need to progress in the field of higher education.
2012	Argosy provides a platform by which students are able to connect with esteem practitioners in their field of study, to gain exposure to first-hand real life experiences.
2012	Argosy further provides the foundation upon which students can begin their pursuit of becoming a scholar.
2012	For this, I am grateful.

2012	Acknowledgements
2012	ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Though I might have longed for it at times, no dissertation writes itself.
2012	I have been fortunate to have the support of family, friends, mentors, and colleagues throughout this process, and without them this research could not have been completed.
2012	The first order of thanks goes without question to my adviser, Christine Jenkins, whose history with this project dates back to our first meeting in 1996, where we had our first of many long conversations about librarianship and intellectual freedom.
2012	Christine�s outstanding teaching, mentoring, and scholarship have inspired me throughout my doctoral career, and it is my hope that the countless hours she spent guiding my research and offering suggestions on my writing find some measure of reflection in this dissertation.
2012	I am also proud to call Christine my friend, a capacity in which she has been as generous to me as she has been as an academic adviser.
2012	As Wilbur said of Charlotte in E.B.
2012	White�s Charlotte�s Web, it is not often that you find either a good friend or a good writer, and Christine is both.
2012	Other academic advisers and mentors have been invaluable throughout the process of this research.
2012	My committee members, Susan Davis and Paulette Rothbauer, offered thoughtful critique and incisive questions at both the proposal and the dissertation stages.
2012	Susan�s expertise as a writer has pushed me to examine my prose for the clearest possible way of expressing my arguments, while Paulette�s own research has inspired me to think more deeply about readers and reading.
2012	Chip Bruce�s feedback on my work at the proposal stage was incredibly helpful, particularly his suggestions for further reading in the field of Education.
2012	Carol Tilley�s questions and perspective were always thoughtful and challenging, and her willingness to join my committee at the eleventh hour was v  deeply appreciated.
2012	The truly outstanding faculty at GSLIS has been invaluable throughout my doctoral education.
2012	I want to thank Carole Palmer, Linda Smith, Leigh Estabrook, Betsy Hearne, Boyd Rayward, and Caroline Haythornthwaite for their support of my work and their willingness to go the extra mile in terms of giving feedback and sharing their expertise.
2012	I have also been fortunate to find a second academic home at UCLA�s Information Studies department, where my teaching and research have been nurtured and supported by Virginia Walter, Gregory Leazer, and Anne Gilliland.
2012	In terms of friends and colleagues, the support and camaraderie I have enjoyed have been truly humbling.
2012	I am grateful to April Spisak, my near constant companion during the coursework stage, for her intellectual generosity and her friendship throughout my time in the doctoral program.
2012	Conversations with fellow GSLIS cohort Chris D�Arpa, Ellen Rubenstein, Cindy Welch, and Kate McDowell have been integral to my doctoral work.
2012	In addition, friends and colleagues I have known for several decades have continued to support my research and encourage my progress up until the very end.
2012	I am grateful to Steve Vaughan, Lisa Gatzke, Elizabeth Majerus, Matt Mitchell, Rob Henn, Dawn Coppin, Jonathan Sterne, Carrie Rentschler, and Kevin Carollo for their friendship and their encouragement.
2012	I have also been blessed with the support of family, most especially my parents, Mike and Sharon Gaffney.
2012	Their example inspires me to maintain a curiosity and openness toward all people, and I am grateful for their love and unwavering support throughout what has been a long academic journey.
2012	My brother and sister in law, Mark Gaffney and Anne Schutte, have also been generous with their encouragement and support throughout this process.
2012	My parents-in-law Peter and Frances Higbie have been vi  consistently supportive and kind and have made me feel welcome in their family.
2012	And finally, my daughters, Maeve Higbie and Charlotte Higbie, have had to deal with their mother fighting �the dissertation dragon� for most of their lives.
2012	They have been incredibly gracious children, allowing me space and time to complete my work, and then allowing me to forget my work in their sturdy arms and raucous laughter.
2012	I am truly the luckiest mother in the world and I hope I will make the girls proud of me.
2012	The final (and biggest) thank you I�ve saved for my best friend and husband, Toby Higbie, without whom none of this work would have been possible.
2012	Though we�ve survived far more than a dissertation together, I know my dissertation process wasn�t always easy for him.
2012	Yet Toby�s support and love for me never wavered, even when I was at my lowest points.
2012	I owe him the greatest debt of all, and am honored that he has chosen to walk through life with me.
2012	Toby, I am still �having a good time all the time� with you and I never want to stop.

2012	I would like to share special thanks with Dr. Christine (Chris) Chairsell for supporting my participation in the Community College Leadership Program (CCLP) and to the managers, librarians, and staff members at Portland Community College Library who tolerated my absences and helped keep me strong.
2012	Community colleges are known to have dedicated employees, and I have been supported by a wonderful network of educators and colleagues.
2012	I would like to thank the instructors who lead us through the coursework and to also would like to acknowledge CCLP cohort 17 for their support and friendship.

2012	I would also like to extend appreciation to the librarians and staff at Oregon State who supported my efforts both face to face and remotely.
2012	Finally, I would like to recognize my family and friends for their support and encouragement.
2012	I was not always around during this process but you were always there for me.
2012	Thank you for your time, encouragement, and support.
2012	I would like to give a special tip of the hat to my sister Joanne for her assistance with the proofreading process and to my parents for tolerating my absence during the writing process.

2012	iii
2012	ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS I want to acknowledge the support of the many people and organizations that made this research possible.
2012	There are two people without whom I could not be at this moment of completion, so I want to acknowledge them first.
2012	First, my husband and partner Otis, who is truly my best friend and most passionate supporter.
2012	For many years, you knew that I wanted to leave Corporate America to pursue a Ph.D. and fulfill a life-long dream of becoming a Professor.
2012	When I met you, this was only a concept and something so far-fetched, so ridiculously impossible, that you set a course to make it happen despite my inability to believe it could come true.
2012	I am sure that this is the essence of love � the ability to see the best in others, to see the most profound, exceptional version of another when they cannot see it for themselves.
2012	This is what you did for me through the writing of this dissertation and, somehow, given all the stress it has put us under, you�ve continued to love me each day as I�ve worked on this goal.
2012	Even as I write this acknowledgement on our brief two-day vacation, you are taking care of business so I have the space I need to finish.
2012	I appreciate so much how you decided at some moment in this process to surrender to the enormous commitment that it takes to study, learn and write, and you gave yourself to it fully.
2012	You were doing everything to make our lives work while I went through a frightening surgery, delivered a baby, and went right back to work on this dissertation.
2012	You knew how much I wanted to contribute something real and meaningful to my community through this work, and you helped me heal physically and emotionally from the passing of my father during this work.
2012	You held our baby and gave v  him baths and made dinner and rocked him to sleep so that I could write.
2012	You got up and went to work everyday to keep us going.
2012	You taught Jylian how to drive.
2012	You did a lot of laundry.
2012	I know there was always a temptation to reject this time-consuming process because you wanted your wife and friend back.
2012	Instead of complaining, you encouraged me to go to the coffee shop and write, and as a result of your generosity, I became stronger.
2012	My love for you has deepened through this journey.
2012	I am grateful we moved to Champaign to take on the work we both had to do here.
2012	I appreciate the family you have given me, and how the challenges have made me a better person.
2012	Despite the setbacks we�ve had, I am happiest with you.
2012	Because of your daily encouragements to do more, think harder, and prioritize my work, and myself, I am fulfilling more than my own dream, but a dream of my parents too.
2012	I will never be able to thank you enough for helping me accomplish this goal.
2012	I look forward to all the joy that raising our family is bringing us, and the incredibly bright future we have.
2012	Now, it�s your turn.
2012	My mother is the other person I want to fully acknowledge.
2012	It is she who charted the course, who cut a path to a life unimaginable for me.
2012	When she passed, over a decade ago, most of my reasons for living died with her.
2012	Every accomplishment in my life was to make her proud, and I had many dreams that we had cooked up together still to be fulfilled with her by my side.
2012	Her part in this work is at the core: she raised me as a Black girl, despite her not being a Black woman herself.
2012	Raising a Black girl was not without a host of challenges and opportunities, and she took the job of making me a strong, confident person very seriously.
2012	She was quite aware that racism and sexism were big obstacles that would confront me, and she educated me to embrace and celebrate my identity by vi  surrounding me with a community, in addition to a fantastically diverse family and friendship circle.
2012	Much of my life was framed by music, dolls, books, art, television, and experiences that celebrated Black culture, an intentional act on her part to ensure that I would not be confused or misunderstood by trying to somehow leverage her White identity as my own.
2012	She taught me to respect everybody, as best I could, but to understand that neither prejudice at a personal level or oppression at a systematic level is ever acceptable.
2012	She taught me how to critique racism, quite vocally, and it was grounded in our own real- life experiences together as a family.
2012	I am grateful that she had the foresight to know that I would need to feel good about who I am in the world, because I would be bombarded by images and stories and stereotypes about Black people, and Black women, that could tear me down and harm me.
2012	She wanted me to be a successful, relevant, funny woman � and she never saw anything wrong with me adding �Black� woman to that identity.
2012	She saw the recognition of the contributions and celebrations of Black people as a form of resistance to bigotry.
2012	She was never colorblind � she had a critique of that before anyone I knew.
2012	She knew �not seeing color� was a dangerous idea, because color was not the point, culture was.
2012	She saw a negation or denial of Black culture as a form of racism, and she never wanted me to deny that part of me, the part she thought made me beautiful and different, and special in our family.
2012	She was my first educator about race, gender and class.
2012	She would talk about the incredible survival skills we had because we were working-poor people, and that we would always make it in this world because we could make something from nothing.
2012	She made the places we lived beautiful by refurbishing thrift store finds � a talent she passed on to me.
2012	She always spoke of the natural brilliance of women, and vii  surrounded me with strong, smart, sassy women like my grandmother, Marie Thayer, and her best friend, my Aunt Darris, who modeled hard work, compassion, beauty and success.
2012	It is in this tradition that this work finds its genesis.
2012	I am focused on trying to keep her memory alive for the next generation.
2012	As this work could not exist without Otis and my mother, this work also would not be as meaningful without the women and girls in my life that inspire me, all of which I am going to try and name, and should I leave anyone out, it is because the time to finish is short, and my mind is old and forgetful.
2012	I beg your forgiveness in advance.
2012	I know you know who you are.
2012	My deep friendships born in California have been a source of strength, motivation and love � the sisterhood that grounds me and pushes me on every level.
2012	These women include: Tranine, my number one; Heather and Karen, my bright lights and role models; Lolita, my sage, coach, and inspiration; Tamara, by sister-from-another-mother and guardian angel; Najuma, always on my mind and a part of every good thing; Veda, my hometown homegirl that I love and miss so much; Ms. Tamsin Nicole, just typing your name makes me laugh � you are my personal stand-up comedian and soul-sister that I love down in New Orleans; my union organizer and sister-activist Sandra G. in Los Angeles (oh girl, we go back � and look how far we�ve come, can you believe it?
2012	); Nadine, you teach me how to live right; Tahira, an amazing poet and a remarkable woman that sent me much love during this process; Jennifer, my dear old friend that I miss, living the good life in New Jersey, and Gia, whose life and family I admire so much � you are still the envy of all your friends.
2012	You are my life-long sisters.
2012	Your families are part of our family, and I love you and your partners and children so very much.
2012	Each one of you could generate a long viii  narrative about your fabulousness.
2012	If I write a book on friendship one day, you each deserve your own chapter.
2012	Your love and friendship has made me a better woman.
2012	We always keep it real with each other and that is the source of our magic.
2012	No matter how much time passes between us, we pick up where we left off.
2012	You keep the hope of California alive in me!
2012	We always find our way back to Fresno and The Bay for each other.
2012	You are the tug that keeps me coming home for another hit of wonderful friendship, great food and wine, and non-stop laughter and love.
2012	I hope to grow old with you.
2012	We have so much more to do together.
2012	I am also grateful for the mother-love I get from my Aunt Darris, who came and helped me deliver Nico, cooked amazing meals, and held my hand to soothe me when I experienced this rite of passage without my Mom.
2012	You did everything, and said all the words she would have wanted you to say to me.
2012	I know we both miss her terribly.
2012	I am grateful to have you; you keep her alive with your laugh and your incredible intelligence.
2012	You were her number one friend in life.
2012	You and Brandi are my heart.
2012	My other mother, Tranine�s mom, Nicki, called me on the morning of my dissertation defense to tell me how proud my mother would be and I almost wrecked the car for all the tears that started pouring out of me.
2012	Thank you for having been such a great girlfriend to my mother, and an second-mother to me.
2012	I love everything about you.
2012	It is a wonder that anyone can live a good life without Jewish mothers.
2012	I am lucky to have two.
2012	Louise grabbed a hold of me when my Mom passed and has never let me go.
2012	You have the kind of emotional intelligence that people who know what that is dream of having.
2012	I love to laugh and cry over coffee with you on the latest happenings that include ix  movies, books, Obama, the NCAA Final Four, your amazing husband Bill, beautiful daughter Lauren and all the happenings in my life.
2012	You are the perfect respite when the mean-spirited people get me down.
2012	Ronna, Lori�s mom, has just the snarky remark and spiritual insight to keep me from circling the drain when I�m nowhere.
2012	I appreciate you making me a daughter here in Champaign and for being there at every major event we celebrate, as well as including us in your family.
2012	You, Tim and Taco are lovely.
2012	I come to your house for the perfect scotch, neat.
2012	My mother-in-law, Mrs. Noble, and I have been on a journey together through a host of experiences that stemmed from our moving to Champaign-Urbana, including marrying her only son, becoming a stepmom to one of her granddaughters and giving birth to her only grandson.
2012	You have been a wonderful grandmother to Nico and I will never be able to thank you enough for giving him the love and attention he needs.
2012	Knowing he was in your care gave me the mental and emotional freedom to go to work without a single worry, which is invaluable to me.
2012	You give enough love for two grannies/grandmas, and that makes me love you even more.
2012	Thank you for all that you do to support our family.
2012	I love worrying about the kids with you.
2012	You raised a wonderful son and I hope you will show me how to raise Nico in a similar way.
2012	Of course, I also could not have completed graduate school without my Sistah- Friend Book Club: Lori, Tiy, Gilda, Renique, Shayla, Jasmine and Adrienne.
2012	I never believed I could create a sisterhood as amazing as my girls in Cali, but then came along the women who made living in the Midwest a good place to be.
2012	Lori tried to lure me into friendship with a high school cheerleading competition, which totally worked, and now I x  am in love with your family.
2012	Gilda, you had the good sense to see we needed a safe space for professional Black women in town to meet and find friendship, and now we have each other and we�ve found a few more to confide in.
2012	Tiy helped me find the cobbler, the Farmer�s Market and the courage to jump into pregnancy because you made it look so easy.
2012	Shayla, your giggle is wonderful.
2012	Who knew such a powerhouse lawyer was in there!
2012	Renique, I want my boots and clothes back!
2012	Why do you wear everything so much better than me?
2012	I love these women.
2012	They took me on rollercoasters and to wine bars.
2012	We exchange clothes, shoes and secrets.
2012	My friend, Dr. P., lovingly calls us the Super-Friends, and we are.
2012	They are my lawyers, negotiators, interior designers, model-mothers, and confidants.
2012	I am thankful to have had your encouragement, hugs, compassion, laughter and deep friendship over these years.
2012	I thought my life was full and complete and that there was no more room for more girlfriends until our �book club� came along.
2012	You brought me out of the grief of leaving my girls from California.
2012	I love your families and we share every occasion with you.
2012	You bring light and joy to me, on every level.
2012	Now I have to somehow meld you with my girls from back home.
2012	Next project: a girlfriends� vacation!
2012	Big sisters and brothers are also a part of this work.
2012	My bio big sis, Sue, is my number one supporter.
2012	She is my safe space to go to when I am troubled, or have amazing things to share.
2012	I love you and am glad that you believe in me.
2012	My favorite brother Walt, who will likely have the most to say about this research, keeps me sharp because we so rarely see eye to eye on politics, and we love each other anyway.
2012	I appreciate you both, and your families, for being happy for me even when you don�t understand me.
2012	My adopted big sis, Imani, continually builds me up and is an intellectual and political sounding board.
2012	xi  You make everything beautiful, girl, and I always want to be like you when I grow up.
2012	My big sister Lori is not very big in stature, but has the biggest Spirit and superb advice on all matters of the heart, which has helped me to tremendously in many aspects of life.
2012	Thank you for being one part therapist, one part smart-mouth, and two parts angel.
2012	I love you girl, you and your crazy husband, and beautiful children.
2012	Tranine Chisom gets her own paragraph because she stands alone as sister/best friend extraordinaire.
2012	We took our first steps on a college campus together in 1988 at Fresno State and became soul mates and sands.
2012	We have been inseparable since.
2012	You have vetted everything in my entire adult life because of your sound judgment and solid character.
2012	I hope this work honors all that we struggle for � to do the right things by our families and our community.
2012	I will organize a conference and make Malcolm X flyers with you any day of the week.
2012	Your children were my first children.
2012	Your husband, Keith, is my brother.
2012	I love you every day.
2012	There are many friends and family members who are my support system, and I feel some kind of pressure to not take up more space with acknowledgements than I do with the research itself, so I will say that each of these people are incredibly special to me.
2012	They include my stepdaughter Jylian, my good friend Meadow, all my God-daughters, nieces and nephews (in random order) Dakari and Kyla, Justin, Max and Marcus, Justice, Cree, Chloe, Jasmine, McKenna and Quinlan, Gianna and Sophia, Ixchel and Itzania, Jahant and Akilah, Angela and Juliana, Aminah, Aaron and Israel, Kayla and Samara.
2012	Thank you to my brothers-in-law: Keith, Andrew, Bryan, Brian E. and Brian M., Troy, Byron, Will P. and sisters-in-law Karen, Nicole, Simone, and Dee.
2012	Each of you have given me a soft place xii  to land so that I could explore my creative, intellectual self, while dropping off dinners, gabbing with me on the phone, texting words of encouragement, Facebooking crazy things, holding a baby, hosting a fun party, and supporting my husband in the many hours I spent focused on this research.
2012	I am also grateful to my Dad, George Green, and my father-in- law, Otis Noble, Jr. for being kind and loving.
2012	You were, and are, good fathers to me.
2012	All of these women, men and children are a part of this process, including the many that I cannot name, but whom I hope will know that they touched our family in some positive way while I was working on this degree.
2012	Christopher V., Keith B., Jeff and Gina, Steve, Mo� and Kenny, Nia Purpose, Don D., Jimmie and Shannon, Neville and Joseph, Susan P., Patch, and Danielle � you are a part of this journey too.
2012	Though I am mentioning this group of people last, it is only because they are the people in the present moment, right up to the final stage of this work that have been involved on a consistent basis in my life as a graduate student.
2012	These are the people in my everyday view � working with me on the finer nuances of my research.
2012	I want to give them the most heartfelt acknowledgement because when I say I couldn�t have done this without them, I mean it.
2012	These are the people who have helped me craft my research interests and cultivate the pages that follow.
2012	They were subjected to countless hours of reading my work, critiquing it, and sharing articles, books, websites and resources with me.
2012	All errors in thinking are my fault, but the best thinking and ideas in this work stem from tapping into the collective intelligence that is fostered by surrounding myself with brilliant minds and subject matter experts.
2012	I am in awe of the number of people that it takes to support the xiii  writing of a dissertation, and these are the many people and organizations that had a hand in providing intellectual and financial support while I completed this research.
2012	My number one academic supporter in the completion of this dissertation is Dr. Linda C. Smith.
2012	She offered unwavering and unconditional support for our family through graduate school.
2012	This research would not have happened without her leadership, humor and incredible intelligence, for which I am so thankful.
2012	I suffer in trying to find ways to repay her � something I don�t think I will ever be able to do, because what may have been small gestures on her part were enormous to me.
2012	She is an incredible human being.
2012	I want to thank you for launching me into my next career and for believing that my work is a valuable and original contribution.
2012	Your stamp of approval is something I hold in very high regard, and I appreciate you so very much.
2012	The passion in this research was ignited in a research group led by Dr. Lisa Nakamura, without whose valuable conversations I could not have taken this work to fruition.
2012	My most trustworthy sister-scholars, Sarah T. Roberts and Miriam Sweeney kept a critical eye on this research and pushed me, consoled me, made me laugh, and inspired me when the reality of how Black women and girls are represented in commercial search would deplete me.
2012	They are my greatest intellectual allies through this process, and I am grateful for the two of them.
2012	Sarah and I knew we were kindred spirits from her first visit to Dr. Dan Schiller�s political economy of information course from UW Madison.
2012	I am glad that you came to Illinois and that you became a part of our family because we are never, ever letting you go.
2012	You are a so good to me, girl.
2012	So wise and real.
2012	I am nowhere when you go off the grid, so stay close.
2012	Miriam, you and I resurrected the �Race, Gender xiv  and Sexuality in LIS� course at GSLIS and boy, I bet they wish we hadn�t done that!
2012	I love teaching, laughing and sharing with you.
2012	Thank you for inspiring the Moroccan patio.
2012	I am looking forward to the Feminist Anthology in LIS that we will write someday soon.
2012	Thank you for making yourself vulnerable in our friendship, and for always taking our conversations to the next level.
2012	My informal and formal research partners and colleagues include Ergin Bulut, Ryuta Komenki, Karla Palma, Vernita Ford Pearl, Myra Washington, Inka Alasade, Angela Slates, Meadow Jones, Michael Brun, Dr. Will Patterson, and Karla Lucht.
2012	Sunah Suh was a great supporter and helped me with the data collection strategy, and I want to acknowledge her help and friendship.
2012	I am especially thankful for the enthusiasm and assistance of the faculty and graduate students in the Information in Society Fellows program who provided a springboard for my work through countless hours of reading and discussion about the current state of economic policy affecting global information culture and practice.
2012	Dr. Dan Schiller has been a source of inspiration for introducing me to the political economy of information, along with Dr. Christian Fuchs at the University of Uppsala, Sweden, who has always encouraged my critical analysis of information and communication technologies in society.
2012	I could not have completed this work without the fellowship and teaching assistantships from the Graduate School of Library & Information Science (GSLIS) and the Information in Society fellowship funded by the Institute of Museum and Library Services.
2012	Support also came from the Community Informatics Initiative at GSLIS, for which I am incredibly grateful.
2012	I am deeply appreciative to the Institute for Computing in xv  the Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences (I-CHASS) and its wonderful team for supporting me intellectually and financially during my graduate program.
2012	Dr. Kevin Franklin is a real friend, and I appreciate all the support you send through I-CHASS and HASTAC.
2012	The Illinois Informatics Institute and the GSLIS LEEP program sent fantastic students my way to learn and grow with as a teacher.
2012	I especially enjoyed working as a mentor and graduate assistant in the LIS Access Midwest Program (LAMP) with Ms. Amani Ayad.
2012	Financial support came from Dr. Rae-Anne Montague at GSLIS with a MixITUp research grant and scholarships that made a difference at key moments over the past three years.
2012	The mentorship of several people throughout this process cannot be understated, including my committee members.
2012	Dr. Linda C. Smith, Dr. Sharon Tettegah, Dr. Rayvon Fouch�, and Dr. Leigh Estabrook, Dean Emerita of GSLIS.
2012	Dr. Tettegah is a brilliant scholar and she walks her talk about supporting Black women in STEM education.
2012	I believe that her support and mentorship in the writing process is what helped me produce the best work I was capable of at the time.
2012	I deeply value you and your vision, but more importantly, our friendship that has blossomed from working together.
2012	I hope that the work makes the difference we believe can be made.
2012	Dr. Estabrook allows me to teach on her team in the summer as a teaching assistant, which is hands-down one of my favorite assignments at Illinois!
2012	I have learned so much from you Leigh, and I hope that this research honors the legacy you created as the former Dean of the Graduate School of Library & Information Science at Illinois.
2012	xvi  Important guidance and support along the way came from my early advisors at GSLIS, Dr. Abdul Alkalimat and Dr. Caroline Haythornthwaite.
2012	Dr. Sharon Irish who taught me so much about Critical Whiteness Studies and served as a sounding board, unofficial advisor, friend and supporter.
2012	Dr. Menah Pratt-Clark, Dr. Helen Neville, Mike and Taya Ross, Dr. Karen Flynn, Professor Chris Benson, Professor Brant Houston, Dr. Bill Berry, and Dr. Allison Clark, former Dean of GSLIS Dr. John Unsworth, Professor John Jennings and Professor Eric Benson are among those who have had many conversations with me about my ideas and how to have impact with research.
2012	Dr. Linde Brocato was an extraordinary dissertation coach and editor who has become my friend, and for whom I am supremely grateful.
2012	Dr. Andr� Brock taught me all about content analysis software and how to be successful in graduate school at GSLIS, and both he and Dr. Christa Hardy are GSLIS alumni who reached back for me to pull me through.
2012	They understood the challenges of being �the only� African-American in a graduate program at any given moment, and gave me the encouragement I needed so that I never felt isolated or alone when trying to do work that went against the grain.
2012	We�re family now.
2012	Many people work hard everyday to make GSLIS an environment where I could soar, and as such, I could not have thrived through this process without the office staff of GSLIS who put out fires, solved problems, made travel arrangements, scheduled meetings and spaces, and offered kind words of encouragement on a regular basis.
2012	Support comes in many different forms, and my friends at tech companies Pixo in Urbana and Pathbrite in San Francisco � both led by brilliant women CEOs � have been a great source of xvii  knowledge that have sharpened my skills.
2012	I want to thank the staff at both of these great companies for teaching me new things along the way.
2012	The projects I have worked on over the course of developing this dissertation, including the Urbana-Champaign Big Broadband (UC2B) efforts with LaEisha, Chris and Teri, have been very fulfilling and a positive distraction!
2012	I appreciate the collaboration with the City of Champaign, the City of Urbana, Maryalice and Dawn at ATLAS, and the Center for Digital Inclusion at GSLIS.
2012	The Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies in Washington, D.C. gave me great opportunities to learn and contribute as well, as did the students at the School for Designing a Society, and the Independent Media Center in Urbana, IL.
2012	The faculty, students, staff and community at the Graduate School of Library & Information Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign are among the most brilliant people I have worked with and our community is world-class.
2012	Our ability to introspectively and critically examine how we can improve our School only makes it a better place to work.
2012	I am certainly proud to have been a part of this School.
2012	I appreciate every student that I have been able to teach and for all that you have taught me in return.
2012	Lastly, I am most grateful to the ancestors upon whose shoulders I stand, and which include my deceased mentor, Dr. James Rogers, Professor of Ethnic Studies at California State University, Fresno.
2012	He was the first person to encourage me to get a Ph.D.
2012	This dream was nurtured by Dr. Adewole Umoja, Dr. Sharon Elise, and Dr. Wendy Ng, who are among the many supportive faculty from the world-class California State University system that paved the way for this process to unfold many years later in life.
2012	I am grateful they planted a seed that could be cultivated by the faculty at the University of Illinois at xviii  Urbana-Champaign.
2012	Anything I have accomplished has been from the legacies of those who came before me, both in the scholarship and in my family tree.
2012	I hope to honor their memories and leave something for the future.

2012	ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS First and foremost, thank you to the 14 young people who volunteered their time for this project.
2012	When my motivation lagged, re-reading their transcripts re-energized me and reminded me why I find this work so engaging.
2012	This project would not have been possible without the endless support I received from my supervisor, Dr. Margaret Mackey.
2012	When I first met Margaret, I had not made a final decision regarding where I would pursue graduate work.
2012	By the end of our first meeting, I had decided to complete a thesis under her supervision and, with the possible exception of marrying my husband, it has been the best decision I�ve ever made.
2012	Over the past three years, she has provided endless inspiration and academic and psychological support, and has continually pushed me to the limits of my intellectual and creative capacities.
2012	Under her guidance, I was challenged to think boldly and take risks even if they did not always work out.
2012	I cannot imagine a better guide through this process, or a better teacher.
2012	During the writing phase, I lived with my parents.
2012	I owe them an enormous debt of gratitude for putting up with my crazy work schedule, the often- disastrous state of my workroom, and my sometimes-compromised patience and erratic temper.
2012	Though they may not have understood my fascination with Glee and Harry Potter, they were always there with a supportive word, or a fresh cup of tea to keep me going.
2012	My siblings, Ian, Christopher, Julia and Lizzie have been like a personal cheerleading team throughout this project and their support has meant the world to me.
2012	My youngest sister, Lizzie, provided the inspiration for this work and so I thank her for being brilliant and fascinating in her use of storyworld media and for being a teenager at just the right time.
2012	Last, but not least, thank you to my best friends: Sarah and my husband, David.
2012	ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS There are many people whom I would like to thank for their assistance through the ordeal of writing this thesis.

Ferriero posted an entry on his blog, arguing that the utilization of social media is �mission-critical� to the National Archives and, more broadly speaking, to all archival agencies: This is not a passing fad or a frivolous use of technology.
2012	It is the future.
2012	It will change even more rapidly than the traditional technologies we have been using.
2012	Therefore, we all need to be experimenting and keeping an eye on the new and emerging social media platforms because that is where our user communities expect to be meeting us.
2012	We have a big opportunity through social media to change the way people think about archives.
2012	(Ferriero, 2012) When David Ferriero became the 10th Archivist of the United States in late 2009, he brought with him an interest in Web 2.0 technologies that had been unheard of among many archivists.
2012	By embracing these technologies as the Archivist of the United States, he set a standard for other archivists to participate and interact with their users in social media.
2012	As he points out, "using social media channels in our own work, we can work more collaboratively, provide greater transparency for each other and the public, and invite the public to participate in our efforts� (Ferriero, 2012).
2012	As the use of Web 2.0 technologies has increased in the general population, it has become an important way for archives to interact with their user communities and increase access to their collections.
2012	As discovered in a Pew Internet study, 66% of adults use Web 2.0 technologies (Smith, 2011).
2012	This figure comes at the head of a trend of increased use in all age groups, and Web 2.0 technologies have come to the forefront of many marketing strategies.
2012	Thus, it makes sense that archives in search of users make a presence in Web 2.0 online communities.
2012	1  Archives, many supported by public funds, have been suffering budget cutbacks and staffing shortages.
2012	This leads to an increase in the number of responsibilities per person, and time becomes a very valuable resource.
2012	It behooves archives to find the best possible manner by which to implement a Web 2.0 technology, which saves time and is sustainable.
2012	It is this issue that this thesis attempts to address.
2012	Defining Web 2.0 Technologies The term Web 2.0 technology, also known as social media, is used to describe the various websites, services, and platforms that archives use to promote their collections and facilitate interaction with their users.
2012	Defining what makes something a Web 2.0 technology has been notoriously difficult.
2012	Even the founder of the Web 2.0 Conference, Tim O�Reilly, in an attempt to define Web 2.0, admits that �Web 2.0 doesn�t have a hard boundary, but rather, a gravitational core� (O�Reilly, 2005).
2012	In his blog post, he outlines several core concepts which make Web 2.0 different from Web 1.0: the web as a platform, harnessing collective intelligence, lightweight programming models, software above the level of a single device, and rich user experiences.
2012	Although some of these concepts are more focused on the back end that users rarely see, many of them shape the Internet as it is currently known.
2012	But that initial definition is slightly dated.
2012	In a blog post for the Web 2.0 Summit in San Francisco, O�Reilly and Battelle (2009) updated their definition to include more recent developments: cooperating data subsystems, the Internet of things, infinite high-resolution images, and the rise of real- time.
2012	With the increasing ubiquity of smartphones, the whole shape of the Internet has changed yet again.
2012	However, these concepts merely give a vague definition to Web 2.0.
2012	2  More specifically, a Web 2.0 technology facilitates these concepts and has earned the more contemporary title social media because of its high level of interactivity and connectedness among users.
2012	As mentioned above, they are usually platforms where users gather and share content among members of the community.
2012	Though the term �social media� is commonly used in conversation to describe Web 2.0 technologies, the term �Web 2.0,� while antiquated, is likely to be better known across wide generational and geographic borders.
2012	Much research on the use of Web 2.0 technologies has been conducted in the context of libraries.
2012	However, little research has been done to address the use of Web 2.0 technologies in archives.
2012	This leaves archivists trying to discover how best to utilize Web 2.0 technologies by trial and error.
2012	This research attempts to fill that gap and provide insight about archives and Web 2.0 technologies.
2012	The Research This thesis research attempted to answer these questions: (1) How are archives using Web 2.0 technologies?
2012	(2) Why are they using those particular technologies?
2012	(3) What are the exemplary practices to implement these technologies successfully?
2012	In order to fulfill the objective of developing exemplary practices, it is important to discover which Web 2.0 technologies are currently being used.
2012	To this end, an online survey was conducted of 245 archivists around the globe, supplemented by semi-structured interviews of five archivists in different countries and different types of archives, to identify current trends and issues.
2012	3  Thesis Content The thesis is organized into six chapters.
2012	After the Introduction, Chapter 2 reviews the current literature on the subject of Web 2.0 and archives.
2012	Since the use of Web 2.0 technologies in archives are comparatively new, it is supplemented by related research on libraries and Web 2.0.
2012	The literature review reveals that although many examples of successful Web 2.0 implementations in both libraries and archives exist and some research has been done to develop exemplary practices for libraries, there is no research to identify exemplary practices for using Web 2.0 technologies in archives.
2012	Chapter 3 introduces the methodology of this thesis research.
2012	The pragmatic epistemology is briefly explained, highlighting how it allows the necessary combination of both quantitative and qualitative methods.
2012	An explanation of archival custody theory follows, elaborating on cultural differences and their underpinning of this study.
2012	Finally, the process and methodological specifics of the study are documented, with data gathering instruments described and data processing/analysis explained.
2012	Chapter 4 presents quantitative results from the survey and central themes identified from qualitative analysis of transcripts of semi-structured interviews.
2012	In Chapter 5, research findings from the qualitative and quantitative data analyses (as reported in the previous chapter) are discussed at length.
2012	The survey results are triangulated with the results of semi-structured interviews to identify and develop ideas for exemplary practices.
2012	Finally, Chapter 6 concludes this thesis by briefly summarizing the exemplary practices explained in the previous chapter and discussing potential directions for future research.
2012	4  Literature Review This chapter first introduces Web 2.0 technologies, why they are important to archives, and examples of successful Web 2.0 implementations in archives.
2012	It then discusses studies on library use of Web 2.0 technologies before reviewing the sparse research on the use of Web 2.0 technologies in archives.
2012	Web 2.0 and Archives Web 2.0 has become an integral part of the Web, connecting millions of people every day through a variety of different tools.
2012	Facebook� alone boasts approximately 750 million active users with half of those active on any given day (Facebook, 2011).
2012	The world of Web 2.0 technologies gives anyone who utilizes them access to millions of new people with whom they might never have interacted otherwise.
2012	Therefore, it is no surprise that archives have, if only relatively recently, begun taking up Web 2.0 technologies to make their resources accessible to the vast population of potential users.
2012	The earliest archival forays into using Web 2.0 technologies in earnest occurred between 2006 and 2007, utilizing both self-hosted and proprietary technologies (Krause & Yakel, 2007; Peccatte, 2011; Ridolfo, Hart-Davidson, & McLeod, 2010).
2012	Since that time, the participation of archivists in various Web 2.0 technologies has increased due to the low barrier to entry and potential for massive increase in visibility of the archives and their collections (Crymble, 2010; Sommer, 2009).
2012	By taking to the Internet and utilizing Web 2.0 technologies, archives become more discoverable online, since the World Wide Web has become the first place information seekers turn to for readily accessible information (Pearce-Moses, 2007).
2012	5  Broadly speaking, Web 2.0 technologies can be classified into two distinct categories: accessibility-increasing and value-adding.
2012	The ubiquity of Web 2.0 technologies makes them ideal for increasing access to archival collections (Pymm, 2010).
2012	Ribbot and Peluso (2003) describe access as �the ability to benefit from things� including material objects, persons, institutions, and symbols� (p. 1).
2012	In order to serve the public interest, users need to be able to access archives and their collections (Menne- Haritz, 2001).
2012	Access to physical collections in brick-and-mortar buildings is limited due to physical restrictions such as location and the need of staff assistance.
2012	However, digitization projects � in combination with Web 2.0-based promotion and distribution efforts � can dramatically lower the barriers to access and make archival collections accessible to those who would never be able to visit the archives in person (Clark, 2008).
2012	Once access has been increased, Web 2.0 technologies also give the archives a chance to involve the community and add value to their collections through community interaction (Yakel, 2011).
2012	Through the use of comments, community tagging, bookmarking, and automatically generated suggestions, archives can increase researcher and user engagement with archival collections and give them the opportunity to contribute value-adding content.
2012	Such user-generated content could be of great use to future researchers (Krause & Yakel, 2008; Yakel, 2011).
2012	Admittedly, there are issues surrounding the idea of users adding permanent value to collections, such as the loss of archival authority, in addition to the more practical concern that �comments have no place in our current descriptive metadata for images and records� (Yakel, 2011, p.94).
2012	6  However, there are archivists who are using Web 2.0 technologies to explore these avenues (Peccatte, 2011).
2012	It must be noted, however, that the use of Web 2.0 technologies is not without costs.
2012	The cost of upgrading the technology in an archive can be prohibitively expensive to both the archives and the potential user (Dugan, 2002).
2012	What has come to be known as the Digital Divide between those with access to technology and those without can make the implementation of Web 2.0 technologies less effective if the archivist�s target community is largely a part of the have-nots (Jimerson, 2011).
2012	The cost of keeping up with changing technologies in the long term can be high as well, which can be an insurmountable obstacle, especially in the current economic climate.
2012	Another potential barrier to Web 2.0 technology implementation is the shortage of staff time.
2012	Many archives, especially community archives, are run with minimal staffing.
2012	Although many Web 2.0 technologies have a low start-up cost and can make these small archives accessible to audiences on a scale which they could never before have imagined, the cost of maintaining a social media presence is primarily measured in time (Brown, 2011; Sherratt, 2011).
2012	Any Web 2.0 technology needs maintenance to prevent stagnation, and this could be beyond the means of some archives (Brown, 2011; Theimer, 2010).
2012	The final and perhaps most difficult obstacle to overcome is the shift in archival paradigm that is necessary in order to fully embrace the functionality of Web 2.0 technologies (Jimerson, 2011).
2012	Having served traditionally as a gatekeeper between researchers and archives, archivists will have to explore a slightly different role -- as 7  facilitator or moderator between researcher and archives -- due to the participatory nature of Web 2.0 technologies (Yakel, 2011).
2012	At the moment, although some archivists are exploring the potential of Web 2.0 technologies to increase access and researcher engagement, they seek to keep the line between researcher contributions and archival objects distinct, or at the least heavily moderated (Grannum, 2011; Peccatte, 2011; Sherratt, 2011).
2012	Examples of Archivists Using Web 2.0 That being said, the enthusiasm with which many archivists have embraced Web 2.0 technologies is impressive.
2012	Case studies from across the globe have shown the benefits and difficulties of implementing Web 2.0 technologies in archives.
2012	In France, the PhotosNormandie project uses the Flickr� commons as a means to foster access to, and discussion about, photographs from the Battle of Normandy.
2012	Although the PhotosNormandie team is not officially associated with any archive, they are drawing upon the resources of the National Archives of the United States and the Library and Archives Canada (Peccatte, 2011).
2012	Though the PhotosNormandie project was started by persons outside the archival profession, the passion of the users involved and the knowledge of the project leaders has helped to provide hundreds of users who are intensely interested in World War II photographs with large-scale access to the holdings of two national collections.
2012	The PhotosNormandie project did suffer from some difficulties, however.
2012	Though the project team implemented a way of embedding user-generated metadata in the images themselves, they did not have as many first-hand accounts of the events in the 8  photographs as they would have liked, due to the dwindling number of World War II veterans still alive (Peccatte, 2011).
2012	The embedded metadata also proved labor-intensive to update as new comments and corrections were submitted.
2012	As a result, though the embedded metadata gave them autonomy beyond the Web 2.0 platform of Flickr, it made their task much more difficult (Peccatte, 2011).
2012	Another example is the scrapbook project in Australia.
2012	The National Archives of Australia created a tribute and scrapbook website that fosters comments and anecdotes from individuals for Anzac Day (Sherratt, 2011).
2012	The use of the �scrapbook� label was intended to help informalize the WWI experience for users of the Mapping Our Anzacs project.
2012	The scrapbook used Tumblr� and was distinct from the records themselves, thereby keeping user-generated comments divorced from the official archival records.
2012	Despite this, within six months of implementing the Tumblr� site, the Mapping Our Anzacs project received 94,000 visits and had over 1,000 scrapbook posts contributed to it (Sherratt, 2011).
2012	Though the project had created much valuable contextual data for the items in the collection and aided discovery for users, all of the data were heavily moderated, which took a considerable amount of the staff�s time, despite the fact that abuse had been an almost nonexistent problem (Sherratt, 2011).
2012	The user-generated data were also kept strictly to the Tumblr� blog with no direct influence on the archival record, continuing the trend of keeping the archival record separate from the Web 2.0 materials.
2012	In the United Kingdom, the National Archives staff created a wiki where researchers could comment and provide useful historical context about archival 9  collections for use by others (Grannum, 2011).
2012	Utilizing the platform called MediaWiki (the de-facto standard wiki platform due to its use by Wikipedia), the National Archives staff created its own wiki platform (called �Your Archives�) wherein the archivists could directly moderate the content.
2012	However, they decided to moderate after (instead of prior to) the posts becoming publicly visible, in an effort to maintain the spontaneity and interactivity that encourages users to participate in the project (Grannum, 2011).
2012	Though the �Your Archives� wiki was hugely successful (with 4 million visits and over 20,000 pages created in three years), there had been complaints as to the reliability of the information in the wiki (though the group voicing these concerns was not specified) and about the fact that the information added to the wiki was not covered by Creative Commons Copyright.
2012	The �Your Archives� wiki�s Terms of Service document stated that the National Archives had nonexclusive rights over all contributions (Grannum, 2011).
2012	These issues were directly related to the perceived need for the archives and archivists to maintain control over all aspects of the records and maintain an intellectual (if not physical) difference between user-generated contributions and the archival records.
2012	The success of Web 2.0 technologies depends upon dialog between the user and the archivist as well as on open access to archival materials and user contributions.
2012	The former was fulfilled through the wiki�s existence, but the latter was hindered by the National Archives� maintaining rights over user-submitted content.
2012	The above examples are primarily initiatives of large government archives that have access to staff and technology which are beyond the reach of smaller archives.
2012	Nevertheless, even the staffs of smaller archives have attempted to adopt Web 2.0 10  technology.
2012	University archives such as the Historical Collections and Archives at Oregon Health and Science University (OHSU), the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and the W. E. B.
2012	Du Bois Library at the University of Massachusetts- Amherst have embraced blogging as an effective means of connecting with their communities (Theimer, 2010; 2011).
2012	The archivists at OHSU began blogging as a way to inform the rest of the library staff about what was happening in the archives.
2012	They blogged about whatever happened to be of interest on any given day, and through the use of the free blogger software provided by Google�, they increased the discoverability of the archive by having regularly updated content.
2012	By increasing access to their collection through Web 2.0 technologies, they expanded their reach to communities far beyond their normal grasp and received donations from a more diverse geographic area than without it (Theimer, 2010).
2012	The North Carolina Collection Photographic Archives staff at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill utilized blogging software to keep their users informed about archival collections being processed.
2012	By posting on average 5.5 updates per month, the Photographic Archives had attracted tens of thousands of visits over two years (Fletcher, 2011).
2012	Though they did not have any concrete evidence to prove that they had increased the use of their collection, Fletcher noted that they had yet to receive any complaints about taking too long to process the collection.
2012	The success of the blog itself probably meant an increase in the visibility of, and access to, the University Archives, though it seemed that Fletcher did not have access to collection use statistics.
2012	11  The W. E. B.
2012	Du Bois Library at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst created a catalog blog (�catablog�) in an effort to bring its catalog of records to a minimum level of description (Cox & Kovacs, 2011).
2012	By utilizing the free Wordpress� software, the Department of Special Collections and University Archives staff created collection descriptions in the form of posts as well as a hierarchical subject index that corresponded to areas within their collection policy.
2012	The index was automatically displayed on a sidebar for easy access anywhere on the website.
2012	The archivists also utilized EAD finding aid information to fill the post.
2012	New collections were added to the catablog within a few days of accessioning, which made them immediately accessible to researchers.
2012	Through the utilization of the catablog, the user was allowed access to the finding aids of the materials before they were even processed, which could have dramatically increased the demand and use of the materials.
2012	The staff of smaller community archives such as the Jewish Women�s Archive, Seattle Municipal Archives, and the Los Alamos Historical Society have taken it upon themselves to utilize Web 2.0 technologies as well (Medina-Smith, 2011; Theimer, 2010).
2012	The Jewish Women�s Archive is a non-profit community archive in Massachusetts.
2012	Its staff has used Web 2.0 technologies to strengthen their community involvement among Jewish women for several years.
2012	They had already established a blog and Facebook presence before attempting to utilize Twitter�.
2012	From November 2008 to December 2010, they posted more than 1,700 tweets, and their Twitter feed attracted 2,400 followers, which led to a slight increase in readership of their blog.
2012	They admitted that this increase might not be entirely attributable to Twitter; nevertheless, that 12  was the only change they made in their outreach and promotional efforts (Medina-Smith, 2011).
2012	Though there was no quantifiable benefit from the Twitter implementation, by creating connections between themselves and their user community, the Jewish Women�s Archive staff established a direct and instantaneous line of communication with their community, which could become an asset for many different reasons in the future.
2012	The Los Alamos Historical Society created a podcast to showcase its oral history collection in 2006.
2012	Heather McClenahan selected 5- or 6-minute sections of oral histories which she felt were interesting and distributed them via iTunes.
2012	Though the process of converting from tape to podcast took roughly 2 hours, podcasts were distributed once every two weeks, and the podcasting appeared to be a popular way for patrons to engage with the collections.
2012	With hundreds of downloads each month via iTunes and thousands of users downloading via RSS, the oral histories were distributed far more widely than they would have been otherwise, especially for a local historical society (Theimer, 2010).
2012	The podcasts packaged the collections of the Los Alamos Historical Society into manageable pieces, which lowered the entry barrier to almost nothing for the users.
2012	Lower entry barriers led to increased use.
2012	The Seattle Municipal Archives staff utilizes Flickr to display its collections online in order to reach previously unreached users.
2012	The archives staff organizes the images in broad categories with an emphasis on interesting content that even a casual observer may enjoy.
2012	The additional exposure has led to others using the images for newsletters, blogs, t-shirts, e-books, and motivational wallpaper.
2012	Users have also requested reproductions, although it is not noted what their policy on reproductions 13  entails.
2012	It takes approximately 10 minutes of staff time to post a new image set on Flickr, and the additional exposure has drawn much traffic to the institutional website and online exhibits (Theimer, 2010).
2012	By utilizing the Flickr platform and leveraging its built-in tools, the Seattle Municipal Archives staff has made their collection visible to users anywhere.
2012	Although the descriptions may not be as rich or as detailed as hoped, the Flickr presence acts as a springboard to lead users back to the archives� website where they can discover more of the Seattle Municipal Archives� holdings.
2012	The lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) community has started collecting its history through a wiki at OutHistory.org, hosted by the Graduate Center of the City University of New York.
2012	Utilizing the free MediaWiki software, OutHistory.org is a publicly accessible website featuring a fully community-created encyclopedia, museum, and archive that document LGBTQ history (Gutterman, 2010).
2012	By opening the wiki to the LGBTQ community, OutHistory.org fills a gap left by institutional archives and gives the community a means of preserving its own history.
2012	Being fully community-constructed, it requires no institutional involvement or maintenance beyond keeping the servers up and giving interested users a place to read stories and view media to which they may not otherwise have access (Gutterman, 2010).
2012	By utilizing the MediaWiki software familiar to anyone who has used Wikipedia before, it does not require users to learn a new set of tools in order to contribute.
2012	Though to a lesser degree than if they had utilized Wikipedia explicitly, OutHistory.org creates a familiar experience for the users with a low entry barrier.
2012	14  As demonstrated by the examples above, archives are using Web 2.0 technologies to increase access to their collections and to increase user engagement.
2012	However, based on anecdotal evidence alone, it is difficult to discern whether or not the success stories are representative of the archival field across the globe.
2012	Many of the activities of the example archives could easily be replicated at any other archive, but perhaps success with Web 2.0 technologies in archives requires more than a formulaic adherence to a few of examples.
2012	In view of the lack of research on Web 2.0 in archives, it is worthwhile to look at studies of Web 2.0 in library settings of all kinds.
2012	Studies of Web 2.0 in Libraries Though the field of archives has some success stories, looking at libraries� efforts of implementing Web 2.0 and related studies may provide additional insights.
2012	The Vancouver Public Library has implemented a very successful Web 2.0 outreach plan for their library system.
2012	The library has fully embraced the spirit of Web 2.0 technologies by putting much of their efforts into creating a personable presence in social media.
2012	For example, their Twitter presence has become one of the most-followed library accounts on Twitter, and they achieved this by learning from mistakes and requiring that the administrator update the account daily, keep an informal tone, post timely and pertinent content, and respond to user feedback and questions (Cahill, 2011).
2012	Yet the Vancouver Public Library has not been without problems.
2012	In 2008, their heavy integration with Delicious�, a social bookmark management service, caused their entire website to degenerate when the application programming interface (API) changed without notice (Cahill, 2011).
2012	They made a temporary recovery, but Delicious (and their 15  parent company Yahoo!�) had no financial investment in the library, and thus made no effort to rectify the problem.
2012	The heavy integration made their implementation inflexible to the changing technological landscape.
2012	The Vancouver Public Library also attempted to utilize Foursquare� -- a popular location-based service -- that gives an honorary title (�Mayor� of the library) to the person with the most check-ins at a single location.
2012	The library offered the �Mayor� of the library an opportunity to write three book reviews and have them featured on the website as a contest.
2012	However, when the time came for the contest to end, there was no �Mayor� of the library to win the contest.
2012	Though this plan failed to attract check-ins via Foursquare, it succeeded in generating public interest in the library.
2012	They received positive reviews and many words of encouragement from users through their Twitter presence (Cahill, 2011).
2012	The Multnomah County Library created a successful outreach program through the utilization of Facebook.
2012	In her presentation at Internet Librarian (a conference held annually in Monterey, CA to discuss technology in libraries), Keller (2011) offered several key strategies to maintain an engaging presence on Facebook.
2012	Many of the strategies important to any big project can be applied to establishing a Facebook presence, including having a clearly defined set of goals and strategies.
2012	One of the difficulties, especially for archives operating on minimal staff, is to dedicate staff time to updating the page and engaging with the community of fans (Keller, 2011).
2012	This observation confirms Samoulean�s (2009) results, suggesting that Facebook, at the least, requires adequate staff time to cultivate and maintain properly.
2012	However, the payoff for such investment can be enormous.
2012	When the Multnomah County Library hosted a virtual 16  custom recommendation event on Facebook, it received approximately 100 inquiries from patrons within 6 hours (Keller, 2011).
2012	Though this is a small number relative to the counts of followers, having 100 users actively engaging with an institution on a level comparable to a brief reference interview would be a very busy day for all but the largest libraries.
2012	The Vancouver Public Library and the Multnomah County Library are very good examples of how Web 2.0 technologies can be utilized when properly implemented.
2012	Public libraries certainly have the most to gain from Web 2.0 technologies with the least amount of work, because they tend to have strong ties to communities already.
2012	Anttiroiko and Savolainen (2011) note that having the staffing means to assemble an online presence and a currently active community is essential to getting users to generate content and maintain interest.
2012	Samoulean (2009) suggests that the primary reason for not implementing Web 2.0 technologies, according to the interviewed archivists, is the time investment necessary to maintain them.
2012	Academic libraries have a user base much more in line with traditional archives.
2012	Dickson and Holley (2010) found that in an academic setting, Web 2.0 technologies were viewed negatively by many users and were not heavily utilized by students.
2012	In a presentation, Brown (2011) commented that academic libraries would likely have difficulty maintaining a successful Facebook presence, because �nobody wants to be friends with the library� and many students want to keep their academic lives separate from their social lives (Sekyere, 2009).
2012	17  Academic libraries may also have difficulty increasing interactivity with their students because they are utilizing the tools improperly.
2012	Gerolimos and Konsta (2011) disseminated a survey to academic libraries across the globe and found that although the most widely utilized Web 2.0 tool was RSS feeds, the libraries tended to utilize the blog as a news platform without attempting to interact with users socially.
2012	Therefore, the problem is not with the tool or even its acceptance by students, and it falls on the shoulders of the library staff to utilize the Web 2.0 technology properly in order to reap the full benefits of its implementation.
2012	Of the academic libraries surveyed, 38% had some form of Facebook presence, with the average �like� count being only 750, though the difference between the highest and lowest counts (7,864 and 34 respectively) was enormous.
2012	This finding supports the idea that the acceptance depends heavily on understanding user interaction and utilizing the technology properly (Brown, 2011; Cahill, 2011; Gerolimos & Konsta, 2011).
2012	Techniques working well for public libraries may not be applicable to academic libraries because their user base is entirely different.
2012	The Vancouver Public Library was successful because it took the time to gather feedback -- through both informal methods (such as Twitter responses) and formal methods (such as patron surveys, focus groups, and one-on-one interviews) -- and modify its web presence to meet users� expectation (Cahill, 2011).
2012	The survey conducted by Gerolimos and Konsta (2011), covering 12 different tools utilized in academic libraries, revealed a popular misconception.
2012	That is, to be successful a library needs to implement every different kind of Web 2.0 technologies to cast the net as widely as possible.
2012	This misconception can lead to 18  spreading the limited resources of any library far too thinly.
2012	As shown by Brown�s (2011) and other studies of successful cases, it is important to begin with one tool which will work for the institution�s unique situation and make that a success before attempting to implement another.
2012	In this way, librarians and archivists can take a targeted approach to marketing and focus on quality over quantity.
2012	Studies of Web 2.0 in Archives There are numerous blogs, articles, and even a book on Web 2.0 in archives, but the literature on Web 2.0 adoption is largely anecdotal (Theimer, 2010), and only a few empirical studies can be found.
2012	Crymble�s (2010) study of Facebook and Twitter usage provides a general idea about archives� adoption of those tools, but is limited to two services primarily utilized for promotional purposes.
2012	The study found that what drove people to follow an archive on Facebook or Twitter was mostly its reputation and consequent popularity, as opposed to posting activity.
2012	Larger institutions such as the Library of Congress and the Smithsonian have utilized services like Flickr to great effect, but smaller archives could have different results from these high-profile institutions (Clark, 2008; Kalfatovic, Kapsalis, Spiess, Van Camp, & Edson, 2008).
2012	Facebook pages associated with important causes or representing a strong community were also the most popular, regardless of the content disseminated (Crymble, 2010).
2012	The Facebook pages in Crymble�s survey were seldom updated, and therefore user engagement was likely low regardless of the quantity of followers.
2012	Keller (2011) suggests that regular updates on Facebook and maintaining an informal tone can increase engagement.
2012	Though Keller�s 19  observation is of public libraries, the basic means of driving interaction should still be applicable for archives.
2012	Samoulean�s (2009) study surveying the implementation of Web 2.0 technologies in archives covered five broad social media categories (including blogs, wikis and social networking sites, ratings and reviews, podcasting, and bookmarking) as implemented on the archive�s website.
2012	The study was also limited to archives websites with digital collections, with digital collection defined as �digital resources organized into collections spanning a range of subjects that support the research needs of its community� (p. 22).
2012	The survey results showed that of 213 archival repositories evaluated, 85 (40%) hosted a digital collection, and of those, 38 (45%) used some Web 2.0 technology.
2012	The survey results also suggested that the content management system (e.g.
2012	CONTENTdm) played a large role in determining which Web 2.0 technology was to be locally implemented by the archival repository (third-party Web 2.0 technologies were outside the scope of the study).
2012	The choice of using third-party versus homegrown content management systems appeared to affect the number and diversity of Web 2.0 features made available to the user community, with third-party technologies being much more limited in scope than their locally hosted counterparts.
2012	However, the interviews suggested that though the locally hosted technologies allowed more versatility, they were more difficult to implement and maintain.
2012	With the limitations in staff and budget, commercial systems are likely becoming an increasingly attractive option to archives, given their readily available communities, ease of setup, and the fact that they are free (Crymble, 2010; Theimer, 2010).
2012	20  Samoulean�s (2009) interviews showed that 57% of the respondents� impetus for implementing Web 2.0 technologies was promotion of collections.
2012	Also, 71% considered patron or user service to be the driving force behind the technologies.
2012	One respondent noted feedback from users who wanted to do more with the digital objects such as commenting and sharing information.
2012	The interviews revealed that the biggest detriment to Web 2.0 technologies was the investment of time in maintaining the technology while still having to perform traditional duties.
2012	The interviews also revealed that feedback regarding the Web 2.0 technologies was purely anecdotal and that none of the surveyed archives tracked use with a formal feedback mechanism.
2012	However, interviewees did note increases in requests for scans, donations, and requests to see original materials.
2012	However, Samoulean�s (2009) study is unnecessarily narrow in scope.
2012	In the age of Internet, it is important to remember that there are other nations (most notably Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom) from which American archivists can learn and borrow techniques and strategies.
2012	Samoulean�s study was limited to American archives affiliated with a college or university, with words such as �archives� or �special collections� being part of their names.
2012	This leaves out international archives as well as community archives or any archive which did not explicitly name itself as such.
2012	Institutional repositories or archives with clever names might have been excluded from the study.
2012	Samoulean�s (2009) study also limited itself to archives with a large digitized collection.
2012	Archives without funding for large digitization projects would have been excluded even though Web 2.0 technologies were utilized to increase access to physical 21  collections, as noted anecdotally by the interviewees.
2012	Furthermore, it is possible that archivists may be utilizing third-party websites (e.g., Facebook pages and Twitter accounts) for promotion and increasing access instead of implementing Web 2.0 technologies on their own websites.
2012	Such cases seem to be excluded from Samoulean�s study as well.
2012	Summary Though much research has been done on Web 2.0 technologies in libraries, little has been done concerning Web 2.0 in archives.
2012	The few studies found for this research appear to be narrow in scope, either focusing on a specific technology, a specific archive, or a specific country.
2012	Nevertheless, these studies suggest that Web 2.0 technologies in archives are an important topic of research and deserve further investigation.
2012	22  Research Design With more archives utilizing Web 2.0 technologies to promote and increase access to collections, it is important to ensure that the rewards are worth the effort.
2012	The thesis research aimed to survey current practices of making use of Web 2.0 technologies in archives, reveal related issues, and identify exemplary practices of successful implementation.
2012	Investigating the research problem and answering related research questions necessitated the gathering of both qualitative and quantitative data, suggesting a mix-methods approach.
2012	Pragmatic epistemology in conjunction with the theory of access and, more specifically, archival custody, directed the methodological design of this study � a combination of online questionnaire survey and semi-structured interviews.
2012	The following sections cover the design philosophy (including the epistemology and theory), methodology and analysis, and ethical issues taken into consideration when conducting this research.
2012	Epistemology The epistemological framework underlying this study is pragmatism, a wholly American epistemology that flourished in qualitative research primarily due to John Dewey in the early 20th Century (Maxcy, 2003).
2012	He was very much influenced by the events and thoughts of his time, including British empiricism, evolutionary theory, new realism, and the work of Hegel (Maxcy, 2003).
2012	Dewey and the pragmatists adapted these influences in various ways to suit their needs.
2012	Although pragmatic inquiry was empirical, it focused on the consequent phenomena, or practical results of the research, as opposed 23  to being retrospective, which was a primary focus of British Empiricism.
2012	From Charles Darwin�s evolutionary theory, the pragmatists took the idea that cultures and peoples interact with and adapt to each other, fitting within a dynamic and ever-changing universe.
2012	From new realism they adopted a focus on the realities of current social conditions and, in some adherents, a passion for finding ways to improve them.
2012	And from Hegel, the pragmatists were able to abandon determinism and develop an epistemology which allowed humans to exercise control over the inevitable changes of the future (Maxcy, 2003).
2012	Pragmatism was also created in reaction to several other prevalent epistemological ideas of the time.
2012	In that vein, Dewey rejected the objectivist idea that entirely non-subjective data could be collected with total impartiality.
2012	By the same token, he also rejected the polar-opposite, radical, and relativistic view that all observations and findings of social inquiry were relative to the extent of being impossible for any outside observer to understand (Maxcy, 2003).
2012	Dewey instead took a middle ground between the two and declared that the methods of social and hard sciences are fluid and exist on a spectrum.
2012	This declaration laid the groundwork for the validation of mixed-methods research.
2012	After Dewey, it was not until much later in the 1980s and 1990s that pragmatism was used to make the mixed-methods approach a viable option in the field of social science.
2012	It had been denied due to the incompatibility thesis, which believes that qualitative and quantitative methods cannot be utilized in tandem due to epistemological incompatibilities so severe that the use of one method precludes the use of the other 24  (Howe, 1988).
2012	However, after a very convincing argument that qualitative and quantitative data are inextricably intertwined, Howe (1988) then used the pragmatic epistemology to resolve any incompatibility which may have existed.
2012	The fundamental argument for pragmatism, and therefore mixed-methods research, lies in throwing away the dichotomy of scientific truth in hard science and multiple realities in social science.
2012	Instead, it offers a �uniformity of scientific reasoning� which allows qualitative and quantitative methods to exist side by side (Howe, 1998, p.14).
2012	It leaves much up to the researcher to decide how the combination of quantitative and qualitative elements is to be applied to research, theory, and method, and it allows for the co-existence of both methods in a single study which will hopefully provide a clearer answer than the exclusive use of either.
2012	The pragmatic epistemology has been utilized in several recent studies, including doctoral work in the field of library science, because it allows for generalizable results from the quantitative data, while still allowing for more in-depth findings from the qualitative data (Inzerilla, 2012; Romaniuk, 2012).
2012	While using the pragmatic epistemology, it is necessary to conduct research that is practically applicable and that will positively influence society.
2012	As Romaniuk (2012) points out, the pragmatic epistemology focuses heavily on real-world applicable results, which is the primary objective of this thesis research -- to discover exemplary practices of implementing Web 2.0 technologies in archives.
2012	25  Archival Custody Theory Archival custody theory influences how archivists and researchers deal with archival records and, as Web 2.0 technologies have facilitated access between individuals, it is the ideal theory for framing the research question.
2012	This section gives a brief review of the theory of archival custody, and the way it informs the methodological design of this study is explained.
2012	One of the consistencies in archival practice in the last 250 years has been the interaction between archivists and researchers (Bastian, 2002).
2012	In the traditional paradigm, the archivist acts as a gatekeeper, facilitating interactions between the researcher and the archival collections.
2012	As Bastian (2002) points out, control over records has historically been restricted to �keepers�, and that the early custodial role was often one of power.
2012	In such a role, the archivist or records keeper has direct control over access to historical documentation, which can shape the very history of a person or people.
2012	Yet, archival custody has many different meanings, depending on when and where it is mentioned.
2012	Archival thought concerning custody in the United States focuses around appraisal strategies in an effort to grapple with the tide of records being created while still preserving history as it happens (Bastian, 2002).
2012	However, this can lead to a bias in records retention.
2012	If the decision of what to preserve is left with the appraiser, it could be so far removed from the origin of the records that he/she believes the records are unimportant (Wakimoto, 2012).
2012	For example, the National Archives of the United States staff supports centralized custody in an effort to protect and ensure evidential value.
2012	26  In Canada, Duranti (1996) introduced the idea of the archival threshold, which emphasizes continuous custody and physical security.
2012	In such a model of custody, the archives are seen as a place of inviolable security and authority, and �any document that has passed the archival threshold, for as long as it exists, is truly a monument to its creator�s actions� (p. 247).
2012	This theory of custody attempts to maintain authenticity of documents by treating the archives as a fortress against outside influence, and as such it likely increases barriers to access as a trade-off for increased authority of the records.
2012	If too many persons were allowed to tamper with the archival records, their authoritative value would be diminished.
2012	In contrast, Australian thought is generally aligned with the theory of the archival continuum, within which access and custody are points, and records can move along the continuum depending upon the situation.
2012	The ultimate goal of the archival continuum model is for the archivist to take an active role in the formation of archival records.
2012	By integrating recordkeeping and archival practices, the continuum approach hopes to be able to cope with the near-infinite expansion of records, and although it has its roots in Australian practice, it has adherents in the United States and Canada (Upward, McKemmish, & Reed, 2011).
2012	These models of custody fail to take into account the idea that records are only valuable so long as there are people to use them.
2012	Some, including Bearman (1991), rally in support of distributed physical custody with centralized legal/intellectual custody in view of technological developments in recent years.
2012	Since today�s technology allows for multiple identical copies of documents to be created with minimal effort, maintaining 27  intellectual or legal custody of records allows the authoritative copy to remain in the archives while allowing nearly unlimited access to it.
2012	Bearman�s (1991) idea of maintaining a user-focused approach to archival custody is echoed by researchers who actually utilize the archival collections.
2012	In more recent years, researchers increasingly desire more immediate access to collections without the archivist acting as an intermediary (Duff, Craig, & Cherry, 2004).
2012	In the contemporary era, instantaneous access is becoming an expectation due to the ubiquity of access to other forms of information.
2012	Though limited in scope to Canadian researchers, the idea that �[researchers] clearly would like to have the archives� finding aids accessible at their computers or work stations and would benefit also by direct access to digitized historical documents� (p. 71) could likely be applied universally.
2012	This is not to say that the archivists� expertise is no longer required, but merely that in the contemporary world of heightened global connectivity, online access to archival finding aids and archival collections are desired by researchers, and the practice of archival custody should evolve to suit those needs.
2012	Since custody theory has largely to do with accessing collections, it is important to understand which Web 2.0 technologies are best used for promoting collections.
2012	Many Web 2.0 technologies have the potential of allowing researchers to influence the creation of a collection.
2012	With this taken into consideration, the idea of archivists being the sole custodian of records becomes difficult to defend.
2012	In order to implement Web 2.0 technologies in archives successfully, the role of the archivist must shift from being a gatekeeper to being a collaborator.
2012	The user community becomes integral to the 28  generation and maintenance of the archival collections.
2012	And it is this newer interpretation of archival custody that informs this thesis research.
2012	Methodology: A Mixed-Methods Approach The thesis research is a mixed-methods study, combining an online questionnaire survey and semi-structured interviews, implemented in two phases.
2012	Mixed-methods studies are characterized by combined use of both quantitative and qualitative techniques of data gathering and data analysis.
2012	The first phase of this study involved distributing a questionnaire on the Internet, which reached the broadest population possible, allowing for increased generalizability.
2012	The quantitative data from the online survey allowed the researcher to assess the ubiquity of Web 2.0 implementation and to discover what archives were using Web 2.0 technologies as well as which technologies were most heavily utilized.
2012	The qualitative materials from the interviews then allowed for more in- depth exploration and additional understanding of findings from the survey.
2012	The Online Survey Research Population and Survey Distribution.
2012	The targeted research population of this study was archivists.
2012	To increase the scope of coverage and responses of the survey, no random sampling of the research population was attempted.
2012	The survey � implemented as a Google Form -- was distributed by posting messages (including a clickable link to the survey site) to the following listservs for archivists: NZ Records (Australia/New Zealand), Archives NRA (United Kingdom), Arcan (Canada), Archives and Archivists (United States), Archivists Toolkit User Group (run through the Society of 29  American Archivists, but no specific geographic affiliation), and the Archives Management Roundtable (United States).
2012	An attempt was made to distribute the survey to the Association of Moving Image Archivists listserv as well, but it was unsuccessful due to issues with subscription.
2012	In addition to distribution through the listservs, the survey was also posted on Twitter and retweeted by Kate Theimer, a prominent connector among archivists on Twitter, for increased exposure.
2012	This multi-point distribution approach was used for two reasons.
2012	First, it was believed that approaching archivists through digital means would reach the greatest number of people across the most geographically diverse areas possible.
2012	Secondly, due to lack of financial support, a free distribution method was preferable.
2012	It was understood at the beginning that this could skew results toward archivists who were more technologically inclined, but this was viewed as a minimal risk in the face of the above considerations.
2012	On the other hand, distributing the survey on a global scale helped to reduce cultural biases in management style and technological ubiquity.
2012	By distributing the survey through listservs as well as social media outlets, it was hoped that the data would not be biased toward respondents with preference one way or the other in regard to use of Web 2.0 technologies, as listservs predate the popularity of most Web 2.0 technologies.
2012	A URL shortener (goo.gl) was used to track how many link clicks the survey site received.
2012	The clicks were primarily from the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and New Zealand.
2012	The actual responses originated from nearly every state in the continental United States (except Montana, the Dakotas, and New Mexico), six out of 30  the ten Canadian Provinces, Wales, England and Scotland in the United Kingdom, both islands of New Zealand, and two Australian Territories.
2012	In September 2011, when the link was initially released, it received approximately 1,000 clicks from at least 10 different countries, with the majority coming from the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and New Zealand.
2012	The other countries (Ireland, Australia, Trinidad and Tobago, Brazil, Switzerland, and Germany) each produced less than 10 clicks.
2012	When asked how they heard about the survey, an overwhelming majority (84%) of respondents indicated that they had received the survey through a listserv.
2012	Only 10% clicked the link through Twitter.
2012	Presumably, many respondents probably had already acted upon the listserv post by the time they received the link from Twitter.
2012	Survey Questionnaire.
2012	The survey questionnaire (see Appendix A) was developed in-house, consisting of 14 questions organized into five parts (with Part 5 being optional).
2012	The first part focused on gathering information about the archivist and their institution, the second part on Web 2.0 technologies for promotional use, and the third part on Web 2.0 technologies for researcher engagement.
2012	The fourth part was of open-ended questions for gathering additional information, and the fifth (optional) part concerned recruiting interviewees for the second phase of the study.
2012	Once implemented as a web site, three experts in the field of archives and Web 2.0 were asked to review it for validation and improvements.
2012	These three experts are Mary Samouelian (Duke University Archives), Kate Theimer (Freelancer), and Dr. Elizabeth Yakel (School of Information, University of Michigan).
2012	Changes to the survey were informed by feedback from these experts, which included decreasing the number of 31  pages, increasing the size of the text boxes, leaving room for write-ins, adding the open- ended question concerning exemplary practices (Question #9), and expanding the list of specific technologies included in the multiple-choice sections (Questions #6 & #8).
2012	Dr. Yakel�s feedback was particularly influential of the revision of the survey, as most of the major changes came at her suggestion.
2012	Her opinions were held in high regard for her extensive experience of conducting research in the fields of archives and Web 2.0 technologies.
2012	The survey questions were primarily about whether archivists used Web 2.0 technologies and what technologies they used.
2012	The technologies were grouped into two broad categories: for promotion, and for engagement.
2012	Web 2.0 technologies used for promotion included Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube, as they served primarily to bring archival collections to those who might otherwise not be aware of them and to increase their user bases.
2012	Web 2.0 technologies used to increase researcher engagement included wikis, tagging, and recommendations, as these allowed researchers to add content to the archival collections which could prove a valuable resource to archival institutions (Krause & Yakel, 2007; Peccatte, 2011; Sherratt, 2011; Yakel, 2011; Zinkham & Springer, 2011).
2012	Survey Responses.
2012	The online survey started on August 6, 2011 and remained open until August 31, 2011.
2012	A total of 245 archivists responded to the survey from approximately seven countries over the 25-day period, yielding about 9.8 responses per day on average.
2012	However, it should be noted that the vast majority (88.2%) of responses were collected in the first week.
2012	Given the approaches taken to distribute the online 32  survey, it is impossible to determine the exact scope of sampling in quantitative terms.
2012	Therefore, it is infeasible to determine the survey�s response rate exactly.
2012	However, if using the total number (1000) of tracked clicks as reference, the response rate would be 24.5%.
2012	The Semi-Structured Interview Participants for the second phase of the study, the semi-structured interview, were selected from a group of 66 survey respondents who offered their contact information and expressed willingness to be interviewed.
2012	Initially, six survey respondents were selected, and an email was sent to these six individuals on November 11, 2011 to initiate contact.
2012	However, only three responded.
2012	As a result, three more respondents had to be included to fill the vacant spots, and they were contacted via email on December 9, 2011.
2012	In the end, six survey respondents from four different countries and three different types of archives were confirmed for the interview, which ensured cultural and institutional representativeness to a reasonable extent.
2012	Interview Guide.
2012	An interview guide was developed to ensure consistency of coverage, consisting of nine questions (see Appendix B).
2012	These questions were intended to discover how and why the archivists used the Web 2.0 technologies.
2012	By finding the rationale behind their choices, the interview would reveal their needs and problems.
2012	Taken in aggregation, identified common interests and issues may be incorporated into developing exemplary practices universally relevant to archivists.
2012	Interviewing Process.
2012	The semi-structured interviews were conducted during January 3-17, 2012 over the telephone.
2012	Although six participants were confirmed for the 33  interview, one person was not able to complete the process due to miscommunication and technical issues.
2012	After interviewing the remaining five participants, it was decided that enough data had been gathered to complete this part of the study, and no remedial effort was made to achieve the total number of interviewees as planned.
2012	The interviews were between 15 and 30 minutes in length and recorded with the interviewees� verbal consent.
2012	Interviewees were asked the questions from the interview guide (Appendix B) in a semi- structured format, and after completion they were given the opportunity to edit their transcripts to remove anything they felt inappropriate to include in the analysis.
2012	Data Analysis The quantitative survey data were analyzed using descriptive statistics in an effort to assess what Web 2.0 technologies were being implemented by archivists across the globe.
2012	The data from the �choose all that apply� questions were divided into individual Yes/No questions, and the entire data set was subjected to chi-square analysis to test for statistical significance.
2012	Where chi-square test was inappropriate due to expected cell count falling below 5, Kendall�s tau-b analysis was used instead.
2012	The qualitative data from interviews and the open-ended survey questions were analyzed with holistic coding, which is an attempt to aggregate themes or issues in the data as a whole.
2012	Holistic coding is particularly useful in studies which handle data in various forms (Salda�a, 2009).
2012	Though considered a preparatory approach by some, it proved sufficiently detailed and particularly useful for this study.
2012	The short answer questions needed to undergo multiple rounds of holistic coding in order to extract the most applicable terms possible.
2012	The interview data were coded first using structural 34  coding in order to put similar data together before holistic coding was attempted.
2012	This allowed for codes to be grouped together more effectively and helped improve analysis.
2012	Ethics Exemption from IRB approval was granted by the San Jos� State University on July 22, 2011, based on the consideration that the information collected was not about individuals and that interview participants were not asked to provide personal information.
2012	To ensure security, data from the online survey were stored on a password protected database.
2012	The majority of survey takers opted not to give any personal information and so remained completely anonymous.
2012	Those agreeing to be interviewed were required to provide an email address and name, which was deemed to be the minimum amount of information needed for initial contact.
2012	The interviewees signed a consent form which included a disclaiming clause stating that the small staff of most archives would make it exceedingly difficult to maintain anonymity.
2012	Therefore, in order to mitigate the possibility that anything said during the interview may be potentially damaging, interviewees were encouraged to review the transcript and make necessary editing.
2012	Summary In order to fully answer the question of whether or not archives are effectively implementing Web 2.0 technologies, it was important to approach the problem from a pragmatic standpoint.
2012	This pragmatic epistemology also allowed for a circumnavigation of either completely interpretivistic or positivistic world views to find answers that are, 35  ideally, applicable to the archives profession as a whole.
2012	The research question needs to be addressed through the custody theory in archives in an attempt to change old ideas and practices for the more contemporary era.
2012	And the mixed-methods approach was considered the most suitable to fully address the research question from as many angles as possible.
2012	These research design choices allowed for the successful implementation of the study.
2012	36  Findings The following chapter reports and discusses findings of the online survey and the semi-structured interviews.
2012	The online survey was primarily centered around what Web 2.0 technologies were used, with minor emphasis on how and why they were used.
2012	The semi-structured interviews were focused on detailed accounts of how these technologies were implemented and the difficulties surrounding the process.
2012	Survey Results As shown in Figure 1 (screen capture of annotated Google map), survey responses originated from nearly every state in the continental United States (except Montana, the Dakotas, and New Mexico), six out of the ten Canadian Provinces, Wales, England and Scotland in the United Kingdom, both islands of New Zealand, and two Australian Territories.
2012	Figure1: Map of the distribution of survey responses 37  Of the 250 participants who responded to the survey, 50% (122) identified themselves as being a part of some kind of academic institution, 23% (57) as associated with a government archive, and 21% (51) selected the �Other� category.
2012	Only 8% (20) identified themselves as being part of a community archive, and 1% (3) as part of a corporate archive.
2012	For the purposes of statistical analysis, survey responses were grouped into four archival categories: Academic, Government, Community, and Other.
2012	Where respondents selected more than one category, their responses were grouped into the �Other� category to ease statistical analysis.
2012	When asked whether or not their institution used Web 2.0 technologies, 84.1% of the respondents indicated that their institution used them in some way.
2012	Table 1 shows the usage types of Web 2.0 technologies by institutional categories of archives.
2012	Though a majority of archives use Web 2.0 technologies of some kind, they tend to be used primarily for promotional purposes as opposed to increasing researcher engagement.
2012	Based on short answers from respondents who indicated that they did not use Web 2.0 technologies to increase researcher engagement, a lack of understanding of the nature of such Web 2.0 technologies seems to be a barrier to implementation.
2012	Table 1 Use Archival Use of Web 2.0 Technologies in General (f/%) Academic Government Community Other n       106 46 85.5 80.7 95 41 76.6 79.1 56 24 engagement 45.2 42.1 38 18 39 206 94.7 81.2 84.1 18 33 184 94.7 68.6 75.1 10 15 104 52.6 31.2 42.4 General use For promotion   To increase     As shown in Table 1, nearly all archives which did use Web 2.0 technologies used them for promotional purposes, and 75.1% (184) responded that their institution uses the Web 2.0 technologies to promote the collections.
2012	It is likely that this is the primary way in which archives are currently utilizing Web 2.0 technologies.
2012	Community archives appear to be more likely than others to implement these technologies; however, due to too small a sample size, the statistical significance of difference in percentages cannot be determined.
2012	Of the 19 respondents (8%) who indicated that their institution did use Web 2.0 technologies but not for promotional purposes, the most oft-cited reason was a lack of time or resources to utilize these technologies, but they also indicated that they planned to implement Web 2.0 technologies to promote collections in the future.
2012	Other barriers to implementing Web 2.0 technologies included a lack of understanding about both their function and purpose, that promotion was already being conducted through a parent agency, and that they were not allowed to promote collections due to either being an internal archive or resistance from the communication department.
2012	Table 2 displays the frequency distribution of Web 2.0 technologies being used for promotional purposes.
2012	There is a statistically significant difference between archival types in regard to Facebook, Flickr, and blogging.
2012	Government archives were more likely to use Flickr, academic archives are more likely to use blogs, and community archives are more likely to use Facebook.
2012	Community archives also seem more likely to have Twitter accounts than other types of archives, though the difference in percentages is not statistically significant.

2012	Many more technologies were also included in the survey.
2012	Their frequencies of indicated use for promotional purpose were extremely low, making it meaningless to test for statistical significance.
2012	Besides those listed in Table 2 without a chi-square and p value, others with even lower frequencies (less than 5 in total for each) include: self- hosted wiki, adding to Wikipedia, Tumblr, LinkedIn, LibGuides, Vimeo, other photo hosting sites, and Slideshare.
2012	When asked to list any tools not suggested in the multiple- 40  choice section, many respondents listed resources that were not Web 2.0 technologies at all, which suggests a lack of understanding about what constitutes a Web 2.0 technology.

2012	The survey asked participants to indicate what specific Web 2.0 technologies were utilized to increase researcher engagement, and the frequency distribution is presented in Table 3.
2012	It appears that user-generated tagging was most widely implemented and more likely to be used by government archives, with the difference being statistically significant at a confidence level of 90%.
2012	Unfortunately, many respondents did not know if any or what technology were utilized in their archival institutions for increasing researcher engagement.
2012	The data suggested that this lack of awareness was significantly more likely in community archivists.
2012	But earlier results showed that community archives had the highest percentage of using Web 2.0 technologies for increasing researcher engagement.
2012	This apparent contradiction may be 41  due to either lack of understanding of related terminologies or misinterpretation of the survey question.
2012	When prompted to list any additional tools and features not included in the survey question, 39% (13) of participants indicated their belief that third party comments, such as those on a Facebook page, increased researcher engagement.
2012	In the same vein, 36% (12) felt similarly about in-house commenting, such as on their blogs.
2012	Only one respondent indicated that users could upload their own content to the archivists, but five respondents indicated that they had future plans to implement Web 2.0 technologies to increase researcher engagement.
2012	Of the 68 participants who responded to the open-ended question of �why Web 2.0 technologies haven�t been implemented to increase researcher engagement,� 32% (22) indicated a lack of resources, 13% (9) indicated a worry about loss of control or authority, 9% (6) had concerns about the return on investment, and 4% (3) had administrative issues keeping them from implementation.
2012	However, 22% (15) indicated they had plans to implement Web 2.0 technologies to increase researcher engagement in the future.
2012	The implementation rate for Web 2.0 technologies to increase researcher engagement was very low in comparison to their use for promotional purposes.
2012	Many responses to the open-ended questions indicated confusion concerning what constituted such technology.
2012	Therefore, further research in this area could prove fruitful.
2012	The final question on the survey asked respondents what advice they would give to other archivists who are looking to implement Web 2.0 technologies at their institution.
2012	Out of 86 total responses, 17% (15) placed importance on planning before 42  implementation, 15% (13) warned about the time commitment necessary, and an equal number mentioned interaction with a community.
2012	Also, 13% (11) of respondents suggested looking to other successful programs as examples, and an equal number suggested some form of evidence-based practice as defined by Booth and Brice (2004).
2012	Only 10% (9) emphasized engagement with the target audience as a way of creating a successful Web 2.0 program.
2012	Although 8% (7) expressed concern or warned about the difficulty to quantify return on investment, an equal number were adamant that implementing Web 2.0 technologies was important.
2012	Finally, 7% (6) emphasized partnerships of one kind or another, and 6% (5) indicated that updating frequently was important.
2012	Interview Results For ease of discussion, the interviewees will be referred to as five different Greek goddesses: Demeter, from an American academic archive; Iris, from an American government archive; Nike, from a Canadian city archive; Artemis, from a New Zealand community archive; and Selene, from an English corporate archive.
2012	During the course of the interviews, five main themes arose which were common with all of the interviewees: (a) The archives chose their particular Web 2.0 technologies based primarily on the perceived time it would take to use (i.e.
2012	the less time needed, the better); (b) Upper administration offered little more than verbal support to the archives; (c) The idea to use Web 2.0 technologies was first embraced primarily by those at the bottom of the management hierarchy; (d) Partnerships were very beneficial, if not necessary, for their successful implementation of Web 2.0 technologies in archives; And (e) community 43  interaction was essential.
2012	These different themes are further explored in the following sections.
2012	Choosing Technologies.
2012	One of the primary reasons that Web 2.0 technologies are adopted by archives, or anyone, is their belief that it takes very little effort to use and maintain.
2012	When asked why particular technologies were chosen, it was almost always because it was something that could be done with minimal effort.
2012	Demeter explained, �We definitely chose Flickr just because of its ease of use.
2012	And certainly Facebook and Twitter probably go along with that...a lot of times it�s the ease of use that we kind of based our decision on.� With most archives� staff numbering well under ten, everyone�s time is valuable.
2012	This closely correlates with the results of the survey, showing that respondents were primarily concerned with the time cost of using Web 2.0 technologies.
2012	What really drives the choice is the perceived ease of use.
2012	For example, Iris mentioned that �what the archives did not want to get into was dedicating much of a staff person�s time to doing frequent tweets and short bursts.� Twitter was perceived as being labor intensive due to the need for constant attention.
2012	Their alternative plan was pre- planning a blog which they decided to do in January but �[didn�t] actually go live until July so we tried to compile enough content to have content for the first three months before we ever went live so that we�that was one of our main concerns: that we didn�t want to start something that we couldn�t sustain and maintain well.� Because Twitter was perceived as having a high maintenance cost, they instead opted for a long-form technology which needed a different kind of operation cost in the form of gathering and preparing content.
2012	44  In contradiction to the perceptions of Iris, Nike maintained that Twitter was easy enough to use if implemented properly.
2012	By encouraging staff to monitor the archives� Twitter account on their personal devices, responses to questions can be given quickly, which encourages more questions in a snowball effect of sorts.
2012	She stressed that Twitter is �the one sort of not-quite-real-time but conversational one, and the rest of them we can put up as we want-- and time permits.� The city archive with which Nike is affiliated appeared to use Twitter primarily to promote conversation and interaction with minimal time cost, presumably also in support of any reference services required.
2012	These apparent contradictions are actually the difference between the ease of use versus the effort of maintenance.
2012	Blogging is a straightforward Web 2.0 technology to use; it requires no additional knowledge beyond the ability to compose a brief report or narrative.
2012	In this regard, blogging has a relatively shallow learning curve; however, it requires much more effort to maintain.
2012	Twitter, on the other hand, is a different form of communication from standard writing.
2012	The character limitations and platform specific mores involve a steeper learning curve and take time to fully understand and utilize to one�s advantage.
2012	Twitter is easier to maintain in many ways because the effort required to post a 140 character message is minimal in comparison to 500-word-long blog posts.
2012	Some archives have opted to take the short-term gain of a shallow learning curve over the long term gain of easy maintenance, and as a result, one is equally likely to be chosen as the other.
2012	Administrative Support.
2012	A commonality between the interviewees was the inevitable disconnection between the archives and the administration.
2012	The idea that it is 45  better to ask for forgiveness than permission was shared by nearly all of the interviewees.
2012	When confronted with the idea of Web 2.0 technologies, upper administration was either completely unaware of how to handle it, or so afraid of anything happening that it was over-planned to oblivion.
2012	Middle-management usually offered verbal support, but never financial.
2012	As Nike noted, �Our direct administration, the manager and our director: very supportive.
2012	Higher up in the city, they still didn�t have a policy, didn�t know how to deal with social media, so they didn�t want us to do any of it.� From an administrator�s viewpoint, Iris noted, �We�re always supportive of people�s ideas as long as we don�t have to, you know, give up doing anything else.� This sort of benign neglect appeared to be the norm in academia as well: �I kept my Associate Dean informed and I think he was okay with it.
2012	They didn�t give us any support, they� pretty much we do it on our own.
2012	They didn�t really give us any support� (Demeter).
2012	But when stepping into the semi-private sector of the archive with which Selene is associated, the gap became even greater with increased hierarchy: �This is coming from some of the staff that manage�at the managerial level, and it�s actually being put into operation by their assistants, so it�s not actually managerial staff or upper managers who are actually putting it into practice.
2012	All of these wikis are controlled by somebody�s PA.� (Selene) By having an increased disconnect between the archivists and the administration, it became difficult to ensure that good policies are enacted.
2012	This is especially true concerning Web 2.0 technologies, with many administrators appearing to know little about them, if anything, and sometimes perceive their implementation as too much trouble to allow.
2012	46  In smaller archives, such as the archive with which Artemis is associated, where the disconnection between middle and upper administration is even greater, archivists were allowed more flexibility in day-to-day activity and policy making.
2012	�Our bigger boss is the council and they don�t really interfere...as long as we�re keeping within the guidelines of the overall charter of the council, then it�s all good� (Artemis).
2012	In this situation, the library management was allowed to act of its own accord, probably because the projects were too small to be noticed by the counsel.
2012	Grassroots Implementation.
2012	Because the upper management often had little or no knowledge of Web 2.0 technologies or the possibility of using them within the archives, implementation was almost always suggested by members of the rank-and-file staff.
2012	At the archive with which Demeter is associated, �Our collections archivist, [name redacted], came up with the initial idea.
2012	And she is interested in technology and the uses of technology, so she�s kind of trained herself to do them� (Demeter).
2012	A technologically- inclined staff member is almost universally the kind of person to implement Web 2.0 technologies in an archival institution.
2012	As mentioned previously, the idea to implement Web 2.0 technologies almost never came from the administration: �Well, as you can tell, it certainly wasn�t a top-down thing... Well, I mean it was staff�mainly me, going �Oh, we should put something up on YouTube� and then going �I think we can handle Twitter�� (Nike).
2012	Though rather cavalier about which technologies to implement and how, it inevitably fell to the Digital Conservator to actually plan and then make that plan a reality.
2012	47  And even in the rare situations where it was the administration�s idea to implement Web 2.0 technologies, it often fell to the technologically savvy archives staff to implement.
2012	�[Name redacted] is the one who really just kinda picked it up and ran with it and has just taken it way beyond anything we ever imagined� (Iris).
2012	And when it came to adding a new technology to the plan, a staff member took personal initiative to get it started: �I�ve been trying to start up a Flickr interest group around here and maybe a pilot project or something like that� (Iris�s Coworker).
2012	Interdepartmental Partnerships.
2012	Since the main problem facing archives is having limited budgets and therefore limited staff time, some of the archives have begun forming partnerships with other departments in order to share resources and increase visibility.
2012	The archive with which Iris is associated includes a museum as well as an archive and their archives attempted to incorporate the museum collections in its blog: �On the blog I do try to include all the other divisions of the agency so I work featuring not only archives collections like photographs or documents but also museum artifacts; and I�m trying to work with our archaeologist because we have a pretty large�from what I hear�archaeology collection.� (Iris�s Other Coworker) Interdepartmental partnerships like this have the potential to mutually benefit both parties by offering more blogging material to the archives, as more posts yield more visibility and the museum department benefits from Web 2.0 technologies without having to implement any on its own.
2012	In an academic setting, the archive with which Demeter is associated had been approached for a partnership with University Relations: 48  �They want there to be more of a presence from our department on there so what I�ve done is, I�m connecting her with [Name Redacted], our blogger, and what we will do is...come up with some kind of schedule� (Demeter).
2012	By working with a promotional department such as University Relations or the equivalent, an archivist would be able to push their content to a more visible location.
2012	This may slightly increase the workload of the archivist, but �it�s actually really nice for us that we will be included in there and it will probably bump up our numbers, too� (Demeter).
2012	Increased attention from other departments could lead to more partnerships or possibly connections with potential donors.
2012	This could explain why partnerships were noted as being important by 7% of the respondents who offered advice to other archives concerning Web 2.0 technology.
2012	In other situations, interdepartmental communication and cooperation may be necessary in order to implement any Web 2.0 technologies at all.
2012	�If you try from another directorate from another part of the organization to break into that sort of marketing to the public, you cannot use that so staff who are in web development, who are in information/knowledge management cannot use that.
2012	That�s a commercial outlet.
2012	So it�s a bit tricky, really.
2012	So within my own directorate, we�ve kind of used things very internally, so there�s no public blogs about the library or the archives within the RCN.� (Selene) In more tightly-organized and hierarchical settings, such as the private sector, archivists could be reprimanded for overstepping their boundary if they attempt to implement a Web 2.0 technology without authorization.
2012	�The communications staff that I deal with on a regular basis...are very positive and they want the archives to be shown off...however, it�s a lot harder to convince the people who are holding the purse strings 49  above them� (Selene).
2012	In cases such as this, forging connections with administrators would likely be necessary before forging any mutually-beneficial partnerships such as those detailed above.
2012	Community Interaction.
2012	Archives are a service industry, in much the same way as libraries are.
2012	Whether serving the public at large or members of a small community, working with the target community is important to the successful use of any Web 2.0 technology.
2012	Demeter suggested that archivists �[do] some research a priori and think about your audience and develop policies, definitely.� By discovering what sorts of technologies are most oft-used by the target community, archives can select the appropriate tool for the task.
2012	What tool is appropriate in this regard varies from archive to archive.
2012	�Some people live on Twitter and kind of expect you to be there, too.
2012	But I�m hoping there won�t be a whole lot of people who live on a million different platforms because we can�t be everywhere� (Nike).
2012	Twitter was chosen by the staff of the archive with which Nike is associated because it offers interaction with the community which fits into their workflow.
2012	Questions are answered on the go via mobile device and �I can carry that with me on my smartphone and tweet on behalf of the archives from wherever� (Nike).
2012	This can be a boon to archivists which are still seen by many as a restricted resource.
2012	When communities are not appropriately served, they can take actions into their own hands, as was the case with the archive with which Artemis is associated: �There�s actually a separate Facebook page that someone started and it�s sort of stories of our city and that�s something we would really love to make sure is saved� (Artemis).
2012	Although 50  the archives had its own Facebook page in this instance, a separate community member started collecting stories of the city, and it would behoove the staff of the archive with which Artemis is associated to work with this community in an effort to collect what has already been given and collect more, ideally on a volunteer basis.
2012	Engaging with the target audience was one of the more prominent suggestions from the survey participants as well.
2012	In this regard, working directly with the community in an engaging fashion can allow archivists to operate on a lower budget without sacrificing service or collections (Wakimoto, 2012).
2012	On the opposite end of the spectrum, working with a target community may not be enough due to lack of understanding within the organization: We�re attending a genealogy event in London and it�s a three day event and our senior manager�s first reaction was to run it past the marketing department who said no.
2012	And we said �What�s that about?
2012	What�s the problem?� and they said... �Why don�t you wait�... And we went �...you have no idea that we�re actually already running a service for, you know, researching people�s genealogies, increasing nursing access services.
2012	You don�t even know that?� (Selene) In the case of the archive with which Selene is associated, the archivists were very active with the community, but were hindered due to a lack of communication between the archivists and the marketing department.
2012	In cases such as this, interdepartmental communication could go a long way to alleviate problems such as this.
2012	Summary The results of survey and interviews highlight many trends and problems facing archives who are implementing Web 2.0 technologies.
2012	It was found that no particular 51  type of archives was more likely to choose a Web 2.0 technology, since the observed differences turned out to be statistically insignificant.
2012	The only exception is Flickr, which appears to be favored by government archives more than by other types of archives.
2012	Qualitative analysis of interview transcripts identified five themes.
2012	Specifically, archives chose their Web 2.0 technologies based primarily on the perceived time it would take to use; upper administration offered little more than verbal support to the archivists; the idea to use Web 2.0 technologies primarily occurred from the bottom of the hierarchy; partnerships were beneficial, if not necessary, for successful implementation of Web 2.0 technologies; and that community interaction was important for a success.
2012	52  Conclusion: Discussion and Future Directions This thesis attempts to answer the following questions: (a) How are archives using Web 2.0 technologies?
2012	(b) Why are they using those particular technologies?
2012	and (c) What are the exemplary practices to successfully implement these technologies?
2012	An online survey was distributed to find out what Web 2.0 technologies were implemented in archives, and semi-structured interviews were conducted to gain insights about how and why these technologies were implemented.
2012	Below is a discussion of the implications of the research findings, including a highlight of exemplary practices that archives may follow to improve their implementation of Web 2.0 technologies for collection promotion and engagement of researchers.
2012	The Current Implementation Landscape The research discovered that Web 2.0 technologies are currently being implemented by over 80% of archives.
2012	Within that subset, certain types of archives appear more likely to use certain types of Web 2.0 technologies.
2012	Academic archives are more likely to utilize blogs, community archives are more likely to use Facebook, and government archives are more likely to use Flickr.
2012	The reasons behind these trends are unclear, but possible explanations can be speculated.
2012	In academic archives, change can be difficult to implement, and long-form blogs more closely resemble respectable resources that researchers desire.
2012	Facebook posts and Tweets would be less likely utilized by professional and academic researchers.
2012	Community archives, on the other hand, rely heavily on community involvement and 53  action.
2012	Many members of the archive�s user community are likely already registered for Facebook, which makes it a perfect platform to interact with them.
2012	Government archives are likely using Flickr because of the precedent set by the Library of Congress� creation of the Flickr Commons.
2012	When the top government archives in the nation have chosen to use a certain platform, it seems likely that others would follow.
2012	What the above difference between various types of archives highlights is the fact that each different type of archives has different needs and different user communities.
2012	It becomes important then that each archive assesses its own needs and that of its users and chooses Web 2.0 technologies accordingly.
2012	However, many of the archivists responsible for implementing Web 2.0 technologies are not doing it effectively.
2012	There are three primary reasons for this: (a) there are so many choices of which technology to implement that archivists are attempting to do too much at once, (b) administrations do not provide material support of the implementation and sometimes even actively prohibit it, and (c) a general lack of knowledge concerning these technologies on the part of archivists and administrators alike.
2012	Too Many Choices.
2012	With dozens of different Web 2.0 technologies available for archives to leverage, and new ones being released every month, it can be difficult for archivists to decide which technology is the right choice for them.
2012	Instead of making a risky choice of one, they seem to be playing �safe� by trying to implement as many different Web 2.0 technologies as they can.
2012	The study found that on average each of the surveyed archivists had implemented three different Web 2.0 technologies.
2012	While already limited in resources, most notably staff time, trying to implement multiple Web 54  2.0 technologies at the same time makes their situation even more difficult.
2012	Because they have spread themselves too thinly, many of these technologies are either abandoned without notice or utilized so ineffectively that they may as well be abandoned.
2012	The Administration.
2012	Administrators control the budget of archives and have the ultimate power of decision making.
2012	Unfortunately, many administrators are also out of touch with the day-to-day needs of archivists, even if they were once a part of the archives.
2012	Evidence from this research indicate that the administrators of archives can prevent successful implementation of Web 2.0 technologies by either not funding the effort or being afraid of the technologies to the point of prohibition.
2012	By not funding the effort, administrators are forcing an already time-constrained staff to expend time maintaining the technology at the cost of other duties.
2012	Lack of Knowledge.
2012	As many archivists, and even more administrators, don�t understand Web 2.0 technologies and how they work, they are often implemented ineffectively and without proper preparation.
2012	Though some research has been conducted on implementing Web 2.0 technologies in libraries, archivists may not be thinking of the similarities between archives and libraries, and as result failing to utilize these resources.
2012	Instead, archivists are implementing Web 2.0 technologies because they know it is important, without fully understanding how they work and how they should be properly integrated into the archive.
2012	Implications As a result of ineffective use of Web 2.0 technologies, the archivists are being overworked and their Web 2.0 presences are not giving the Return on Investment (ROI) 55  necessary to warrant their continued use.
2012	With budgets dwindling, archivists are being forced to choose between Web 2.0 technologies and their standard archival duties.
2012	However, as many archives have valuable collections often unknown to the researchers who need them, these technologies are necessary to generate usage statistics for justifying their continued existence.
2012	To this end, exemplary practices may be proposed based on the research findings.
2012	These exemplary practices will allow archivists to properly implement Web 2.0 technologies at their archives with minimal expenditure of staff time, potentially increase the use of their collections, and make the archives an important part of the greater institution with which they are affiliated.
2012	Ideas for Exemplary practices From studying different kinds of archives in five different countries, several trends in archival use of Web 2.0 technologies were identified, and based on observation of these trends, some ideas of exemplary practices emerged.
2012	These ideas centered around three concepts -- starting small, engaging with the community, and collaborating -- which are elaborated upon below.
2012	Start Small.
2012	If this is an archive�s first attempt at implementing a Web 2.0 technology, it is important to begin small, as there will be plenty of time for expansion later.
2012	�Start small� means: (a) to start with a single Web 2.0 technology, (b) to gain familiarity with using the technology before implementation, and (c) to track statistics for later assessment.
2012	Though there are many Web 2.0 technologies to choose from, it is important to choose a single one at a time.
2012	When choosing a technology, look for one which fits the 56  needs of the archive and the type of collection promotion the technology is best suited for, or which collection is bested suited for promotion with the technology under consideration.
2012	A technology which could suit archives well but has not been widely implemented is Tumblr.
2012	Tumblr has a very active community and combines many of the appealing qualities of Twitter with the appealing qualities of blogging.
2012	Tumblr posts are often shorter than most long-form blog posts (sometimes comprising nothing more than a photograph), and can be reblogged by members of the community.
2012	A single post is pushed to the archive�s immediate followers, which can then be reblogged and pushed to their followers and so on.
2012	Because Tumblr posts are often comprised of a picture and a brief commentary, posts can be created with minimal effort if digitized images are readily available.
2012	Regardless of what technology is chosen, it is important to familiarize oneself with it before implementing it at the archive.
2012	Archivists are encouraged to create a personal account on whatever service they choose in order to familiarize themselves with the interface, expected content, and expected community responses.
2012	Once the lead person has become familiar with the technology, studied the community, and determined that it is a proper fit for an archive presence, he or she can start to introduce the technology to others who are going to be using it on the archive�s behalf.
2012	Make sure to explain the type of content and tone expected by a professional presence on that platform, and perhaps outline a brief policy.
2012	57  Once the Web 2.0 technology has been implemented, it is important to then track statistics in order to determine the ROI.
2012	Since many Web 2.0 technologies generate usage statistics automatically, the archivists need do little to assess whether or not the technology is being used.
2012	It is necessary, however, to track the amount of time spent by the archivists maintaining the technology and compare it with both the quantitative (followers, likes, reblogs, page views, etc.)
2012	and qualitative (comments, feedback, etc.)
2012	values of success.
2012	In this way, if a significant portion of time is spent on generating content for the technology that appears to be having no impact, it can be abandoned in favor of something with a better ROI.
2012	Engage with the Community.
2012	In order to succeed in implementing a Web 2.0 technology and increase its impacts on the archive�s user community, it is important to engage with potential archive users in the Web 2.0 user groups.
2012	Each user group of a different Web 2.0 technology has its own social mores, expectations, and slang.
2012	By familiarizing oneself with these aspects of the user group, an archive can better draw the attention of potential archive users.
2012	One of the primary ways to engage a user group is to participate in it.
2012	Since every action comes tagged with a user�s name, if an archive becomes active in the community of a Web 2.0 technology (signaled by actions such as �like�, re-blogging, retweeting, and commenting etc.
2012	), then its name is spread through interaction, and people will be more inclined to respond in kind.
2012	In a similar vein as responding to members of a user group, it is also important to solicit feedback from time to time to ensure that the archive is meeting the expectation of its supporters.
2012	Soliciting feedback from the archive�s Web 2.0 users can inform decisions 58  outside of the Web 2.0 technology itself.
2012	Since archives, much like libraries, are inherently a service industry, near-instantaneous feedback directly from users of the archive can be very useful in developing and revising related policies.
2012	Collaborate.
2012	Because Web 2.0 technologies are inherently about communication, when the barrier of communication is brought down, partnerships inevitably develop.
2012	It is important for archivists to actively foster these partnerships and collaborate with others in ways that are mutually beneficial.
2012	There are three broad groups with which an archive can collaborate and the benefits vary slightly from group to group: the community, other departments, and other archival institutions.
2012	As mentioned above, developing and interacting with communities within Web 2.0 technology ecosystems is integral to the success of their implementation.
2012	However, archives can benefit from drawing upon the community for assistance in various ways.
2012	If members of a community are sufficiently engaged, they often prove eager to contribute back in some way if asked.
2012	Whether the task is to create logos, discover the identities of unknown persons, or translate texts, engaged community members are often surprisingly helpful.
2012	It is important that this kind of behavior be fostered and recognized.
2012	If a Web 2.0 technology has been successfully implemented, word often gets out to other departments.
2012	It could be beneficial to form partnerships throughout the organization (government, university, etc) whenever possible.
2012	Many archives suffer from a lack of visibility.
2012	By partnering with other more visible departments, the archive can benefit from increased use.
2012	As with having successful partnerships with the community, 59  it makes the archive more visible and valuable to administrators who can then be more easily persuaded to allocate funds to the archive.
2012	Finally, taking the same principle a step further, partnering with other archival institutions could prove mutually beneficial.
2012	By pooling and sharing resources -- whether collections, technologies, or communities -- the two archives can create an impact greater than possible if acting alone.
2012	Since research has shown that archives using Web 2.0 technologies tend to follow/�friend� other archival institutions, it could only prove helpful to exchange information and work together (Crymble, 2010).
2012	By working together, archives benefit from each other�s expertise and both programs will likely grow because of it.
2012	Limitations and Future Research Direction Though this study was designed to be as comprehensive as possible, it was limited by a variety of factors.
2012	Archivists that were not on the listservs utilized for survey distribution or did not use Twitter were excluded from this study.
2012	This potentially skewed the results toward archives which were more likely to use Web 2.0 technologies.
2012	In order to avoid this bias in future studies, the researcher may consider distributing print copies of the survey to archivists around the globe, if fund is available for covering the printing and postal costs.
2012	The survey also excluded non-English speaking archivists, as the survey was not made available in other languages.
2012	Without ready access to human translators, Google Translate could be a possible remedy for circumventing the problem.
2012	However, the translations by Google Translate are often too inaccurate to be helpful.
2012	Another issue is 60  that the survey questionnaire did not yield data readily feasible for statistical analysis.
2012	It was designed to assess trends in the implementation landscape and at the same time gather materials to inform the formulation of questions for the semi-structured interview.
2012	Probably due to the mixed nature of dual-purpose design, much of the survey data defied statistical analysis.
2012	It is possible that a single-purpose questionnaire design and a larger sample of the research population would have yielded more statistically significant results.
2012	Also, the idea of researcher engagement with archival collections appeared to be a difficult idea to express in survey questions.
2012	If a clear definition of this concept had been included in the relevant section of the survey, subjects would have had easier time interpreting these questions, leading to better quality of data and probably even more responses.
2012	The semi-structured interviews involved only archivists which had already implemented Web 2.0 technologies.
2012	Though this assisted greatly in developing exemplary practices, it could prove an interesting avenue of future research to discover why other archivists had not implemented Web 2.0 technologies in their archives.
2012	Pursuing this particular area of research would illuminate the barriers to implementation which could then be addressed, potentially prompting more archives to implement Web 2.0 technologies.
2012	Furthermore, tastes and technologies are constantly in flux.
2012	Future research into the most effective use of Web 2.0, or other unforeseen future technologies, will ensure that the limited time of archivists is not unduly wasted.
2012	How to increase researcher engagement with collections is an important topic for future research, as the idea of participatory archives becomes increasingly popular.
2012	In 61  addition, methods or issues surrounding the preservation of content created with Web 2.0 technologies need to be investigated in future research, as the transient messages generated by archival use of Web 2.0 technologies may prove invaluable to researchers in the field of archives and beyond.

2012	Much gratitude is due to Anne Gilliland and Elizabeth Yakel for conceiving of this important program that has sustained me intellectually, financially, and socially during my doctoral work and will continue to sustain me for years to come.
2012	I was also lucky enough to iv  receive travel grants to conduct research and attend conferences from the Holtz Center for Science and Technology Studies, the Vilas Travel Fellowship, and the Linda B. Richardson Fund for Student Travel at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
2012	I am grateful to my interview subjects for generously sharing their time and experiences with me: David Chandler, John Ciorciari, Paul Conway, Craig Etcheson, Helen Jarvis, Judy Ledgerwood, Ben Kiernan, and David Walls, as well as several who asked to remain anonymous.
2012	Without them, this dissertation could not have been written.
2012	It is not easy to maintain high spirits while researching such a grave topic.
2012	I am indebted to the music of James Brown, for helping to maintain an upbeat mood in countless dance breaks throughout this three-year process, and Jay-Z, for giving me confidence before every conference presentation and job talk.
2012	For my colleagues and friends at the Archives Education and Research Institute, it has been a pleasure learning from and with you over the past three years.
2012	Thanks to: Lorrie Dong, Joanna Steele, Joel Blanco Rivera, Amelia Abreau, David Kim, Allison Krebs, Morgan Daniels, Dharma Akmon, Amber Cushing, Joanne Mihelcic, Leisa Gibbons, Amelia Acker, Dalena Hunter, Michael Wartenbe, Brian Cumer, Kim Anderson, and Shannon Faulkhead.
2012	Together, AERI crowd, we are changing the field.
2012	Professors Sue McKemmish, Wendy Duff, and Verne Harris, also lent their support in crucial stages of my doctoral education.
2012	Thanks are also due to my archivist friends Jesse Johnston, T-Kay Sangawand, and Mario H. Ramirez, who each helped make conferences important sites of intellectual growth and social exchange.
2012	Above all, this dissertation could not have been written without the wisdom, encouragement, and unbridled enthusiasm of my partners in archival crime: Ricardo Punzalan, who always knows which book v  to recommend at just the right time, and Andrew J Lau, who patiently walked me through the continuum model as my head spun.
2012	Their imprint is all over this dissertation.
2012	My lifelong friends have listened patiently as I complained about not knowing my life�s calling, and then, I once I found it, have maintained their patience as I complained about how much work it would take to achieve it.
2012	Carlyn Kolker, Emily Drabinski, Cassie Adcock, Samip Mallick, Ann Putnam, Heather McClean, Sumayya Ahmed, Berta Bustamante, Bridgette Farrer: You are forever members of my committee.
2012	My sister Cherie Caswell Dost and my brother-in- law Hagen Dost have always encouraged me to pursue my dreams with love, interest, and their unparalleled sense of humor.
2012	Last but not least, I am eternally thankful to Tomer Begaz, the biggest angel of them all, who tried really hard (usually successfully) not to interrupt me while I was writing, and correctly assured me that nobody gets sick in Cambodia on his watch.
2012	His effortless brilliance, natural curiosity, and unwavering commitment sustain me.
2012	He will always be the sun and moon and stars in my book.

2013	Acknowledgments
2013	ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
2013	ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The first of many thanks goes to my husband, J. Patrick Whitaker, whom I blame for getting me into this in the first place, but whose love and constant encouragement enabled me to finish.
2013	I am also thankful to my children, Jamie and Brian Drysdale, for cheering me on every step of the way.
2013	I am grateful to my father, who passed away ten years ago, for teaching me his incredible work ethic and love of learning, and my mother, who was so proud of me that she was ready to brag about me to whomever would listen.
2013	Academic thanks go to my committee chair, Dr. Danny Wallace, who made fabulous suggestions regarding the methods for my study, let me make mistakes, challenged me to do my best work, and guided me through the process graciously.
2013	I could not have asked for a more caring or supportive advisor.
2013	I also thank my committee members, Dr. Jason Black, Dr. Suzanne Horsley, Dr. Carol Mills, and Dr. Margaret Rice for being incredibly good teachers, mentors, and friends throughout the process.
2013	I would be remiss if I did not also thank Dr. Beth Bennett for chairing my Comps Committee, without whose assistance I could not have begun my dissertation.
2013	These folks are among the best anywhere.
2013	In addition, thanks to Dr. Marilyn Staffo for her cheerful willingness to help with the use of the learning management system to complete my research, and to Dr. Heidi Julien, Beth Riggs, Reggie Perkins, Cherry Pendley, and Retia Boone of SLIS for their invaluable assistance with cohort coordination and information.
2013	Thanks to Dr. Elizabeth Aversa who suggested a v  study of the online MLIS program and plowed the road for me.
2013	Also, thanks to Dr. Shuhua Zhou and Diane Shaddix for their marvelous administration of the graduate program.
2013	Finally, thanks to Drs.
2013	Eric and Joann Williams, friends and colleagues who provided moral, emotional, academic, and physical support throughout the program.
2013	I could be blessed with better friends.
2013	I need to acknowledge the genesis and evolution of this study, beginning with a pilot project guided by Dr. Clay Davis when I was his research assistant my first semester in the program.
2013	Some passages of this paper were excerpted from iterations of this project in several of my doctoral courses: AIL 604 (Dr. Tim Lewis), CAT 689 (Dr. Margaret Rice), CIS 650 (Dr. Suzanne Horsley), CIS 650 (Dr. Mary Meares), and CIS 652 (Dr. Beth Bennett).
2013	One of the best pieces of advice I received upon starting the program was to gear as much of my course work, research, and writing to my dissertation topic as possible.
2013	This proved to be wise counsel.
2013	I sincerely apologize if I have forgotten anybody.
2013	Indeed, earning a doctorate is a singular achievement, but it is not possible without a tremendous support system.
2013	vi
2013	suggests that event-oriented records could become a part of providing reference services by referring patrons to the community that practices the living record.
2013	With the memory infrastructures found here archivists may see it more fit to help the community document these accounts, that is, if the community wishes to do so.
2013	Still perhaps for others, it is to dig up a community�s memory infrastructures to incorporate new dimensions of time into archival recordkeeping, whether it is through object-oriented records that already exist from the activities the intangible cultural heritage now affords or more radically by accepting that event-oriented records play an important role in archives as living and persistent representations of a community�s identity they can help preserve through other means.
2013	Acknowledgement of the role such a mechanism plays in the preservation of intangible cultural heritage is the first step.
2013	Moreover, in environments such as La Plaza where there are no archives new possibilities of what an archive might constitute could include educational priorities in its mission statement.
2013	For instance, to support varied forms of literacy by using records from the community that can engage student learning in reading and writing, or curating their records over the Internet to connect with family members living in the U.S. Building a historical consciousness through programming activities can also help engage the community more critically about their past.

2013	Acknowledgements
2013	ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This has been a long process, and there are people who have helped in ways they don�t even realize.
2013	There are, undoubtedly, people I�ll forget to name here.
2013	To those people, I apologize and thank you anonymously.
2013	My memory fails me with increasing regularity.
2013	I would like to extend my sincerest thanks to all of the people who participated in this research�both those who took the time (and, in some cases, the risk) to complete a survey from a stranger and those who were willing and able to talk with me and share their insights, frustrations, passions, and stories of the difficult and often isolating work they do.
2013	I hope I�ve been able to adequately convey the thoughts you�ve expressed to me.
2013	I�d also like to thank two librarians who let me visit them at work and offered ideas when this project was just beginning: Forest Turner, at the South Bay House of Correction, and Christine Joubert, at the Middlesex House of Correction in Billerica.
2013	I would also like to thank the members of my committee, each of whom allowed me the room to do things a bit differently, which is something I�ve always needed.
2013	First, many thanks to Ineke Haen Marshall, who has always been supportive of anything and everything I�ve done in graduate school.
2013	I�ve always thought that she has more faith in me than I do in myself.
2013	It�s because of her that I got to spend so much time reading outside of the mainstream.
2013	(People are often surprised when I tell them that I absolutely loved doing directed studies and comprehensive exams, all of which she supported.)
2013	She�s also a sharp-dressed woman with a great sense of humor.
2013	5  Arnie Arluke, I am convinced, is some sort of wizard.
2013	The way this guy is able to synthesize and organize something that, to me, looks like a jumbled mess (my work), is nothing short of amazing.
2013	I don�t know how I would�ve gotten through all that coding without his help.
2013	Not only that, but he does this so effortlessly and with such good humor that every time I left his office, I felt some sort of euphoric sensation that was able sustain me through the next round of writing.
2013	He is, quite literally, too cool for school.
2013	Mike Brown is one of the most brilliant, humble, and kind people I�ve ever known.
2013	Because of listening to and conversing with him, I�ve been able to develop new insights into social theory and look at my work differently.
2013	He has made me a better thinker.
2013	He is also living proof that it�s possible to exist in the world of academia for many years and still maintain your soul.
2013	And, finally, Natasha Frost has been a constant source of support, encouragement, and inspiration.
2013	I look at her in awe and hope to be able to do half of what she does in any given day.
2013	As anyone who knows her will attest, it�s as if she has superpowers.
2013	I truly admire both her intelligence and dedication to her work.
2013	And I love that she likes awesomely dark and twisted films.
2013	Many thanks also to Larry Sullivan at John Jay College of Criminal Justice for taking the time to share his invaluable advice and fascinating stories with me at the inception of this project.
2013	I�d also like to thank a few other faculty and staff at Northeastern, including Joan Collins and Mary Ramsey, who made life a bit easier and more bearable during the past years.
2013	Thanks to Gordana Rabrenovic and Jack Levin from the Brudnick Center on Conflict and Violence for both 6  their kindness and financial support.
2013	Thank you to Judy Perrolle for being the amazing person she is.
2013	Getting to know her during my first semester of grad school made me want to stay.
2013	Many thanks to Alisa Lincoln for being generally amazing and providing me the opportunity to work with and learn from her this past year.
2013	And, last but not least, I can�t express enough gratitude to Steven Vallas, who fundamentally changed my experience in graduate school.
2013	Even though he�s a lousy pool player, he�s a good friend and a wordsmith to be reckoned with (and I think I probably owe him half of my future income).
2013	Thanks for everything.
2013	I always say the best parts of grad school were getting paid to read and, more than anything, meeting my fellow grad students.
2013	You all made these last seven years not only bearable, but (much of the time) actually fucking awesome.
2013	So thank you to the coolest sociology grad students/friends/comrades around (in alphabetical order, so you don�t know who I like best): Justin Betz, Meghan Doran, Trevor Glode, Andrea Hill, Amy Lubitow, Eric Madfis (punk rock sociologists unite!
2013	), Corina Medley, Riva Milloshi (falemnderit), Trish Morris, Sarah Cope Nicksa, and Stanislav Vysotsky.
2013	And thanks to those friends and comrades who are (fortunately) not sociologists and played a crucial role in allowing me to maintain my sanity and some semblance of a normal life while writing this thing: Makis Antzoulatos, Natalija Bogdanovic, Joshua Diers, Maus Diers, Alicia LaPolla, Eric Taylor, and Katie Yang-Gang.
2013	I would also like to thank my family for various reasons.
2013	Thanks to my dad, William Arford, for teaching me to work hard and (partly unintentionally) making me a fighter; to my sisters, Kristi Arford and Wendi Hartl, my cousin, Mindi Mattern, and my niece, Ocean Valdez, for always being there for me, even when things were unimaginably awful�I would very likely 7  not be alive today without them; and to my grandmother, Esther Crusan Arford, who was tough as nails and had a heart of gold.
2013	I�ll miss her until the day I die.
2013	I�d also like to thank my �adopted� family, Tina and AC DeVilliers for their love and constant support.
2013	And finally, to my companion, Lord Owen Leif William McLean: Thank you for putting up with me and for always generously supplying plenty of love, laughter, booze, and rock-n-roll.
2013	You�ll never know how much it helped not to have to worry about shit like doing the dishes and the laundry.
2013	I would�ve been living in squalor without your help.
2013	(And this guy can type one hell of a references list to boot.)

2013	Acknowledgements
2013	ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
2013	ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Throughout this project, I have been quite fortunate to have the support of a great number of colleagues and friends; I am indebted to their generosity.
2013	Before this project could ever begin, even as a kernel of an idea, I gleaned my passion for archives and historiography from Carol Mattingly during my MA at the University of Louisville.
2013	Her wisdom, vision, and inspiration, instilled in me then, have grown with time and have remained an ever-present compass in my research pursuits.
2013	The seed of this idea was planted in Cara Finnegan�s rhetorical theory seminar during my very first semester.
2013	I want to thank her for listening to me with this abstract notion that archival descriptions could be rhetorical.
2013	Without her validation of my intuition, this idea would have never made it to the pages of a seminar paper let alone could have been expanded into a dissertation project.
2013	Mark Dressman�s education theory course, early on, introduced me to many theoretical perspectives, which deepened my understanding of my project; his guidance and insight were invaluable.
2013	To my adviser, Peter Mortensen, I am thankful for the academic freedom with which he let me attend to my ideas and the space he afforded me to let them develop.
2013	His ability to shepherd my project despite some unfamiliar domains, is a testament to his forward thinking and ethic of intellectual freedom.
2013	Peter, and my entire committee has provided substantial support.
2013	Gail Hawisher�s belief in me, and perennial smile, has been a consistent comfort.
2013	Graciously, Kathryn LaBarre fully enculturated me into another field about which I was so curious; I am deeply grateful for her kindness, care, and mentorship.
2013	Janet Keller�s depth of insight and ability to actively listen and think through v  my project has been invariably impressive and serves as a benchmark for pedagogical success.
2013	Lauren Bowen and Tony Pollock have been two of my strongest supporters; I can�t thank them enough for their belief in me and my project.
2013	I am grateful to Libbie Morley for her mentorship in the Writers� Workshop and for providing me with opportunities to deepen my understanding of writing center pedagogy and principles of teaching writing across the curriculum.
2013	To my friends, Karo Engstrom, Vanessa Rouillon, Andrea Olinger, Jessica Bannon, Ligia Mihut, Cecily Garber, Swati Gupta, Shweta Moorthy, Abhinav Bhatele, and many others, I thank you for your advice, humor, coffee-time chats, draft reading, and fun adventures.
2013	To Prateek Mittal, who has served as a reliable sounding board for this project and the process�I could not have done it without you.
2013	To all of my family, thank you for the unwavering support throughout my education�these pages are for you.

2014	viii   1  Introduction Narratives about civil rights history in the United States have often focused on a few key figures who protested in the south, including Rosa Parks and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
2014	Although less well known, northern civil rights protests also deserve a place in the national historical record and are important for local understandings about struggles for social justice.
2014	In order to tell those stories new narratives had to be created.
2014	This thesis explores examples of how civil rights histories of Milwaukee, Wisconsin have been created and used by local audiences.
2014	Historical narratives are an engaging way to impart information about the past.
2014	Historical narratives are especially engaging to public audiences and communities in the way they share memory.
2014	Liberal theorists of memory and their ideas, which are abundant in 20th century sociological scholarship, and terms like collective memory, support that collectively shared memories can strengthen group solidarity.1 Collective memory provides people connections between each other that have the power to maintain history's relevance as a field to the public.
2014	Although collective memory helps communities maintain traditions and can encourage unity, collective memory can also introduce new historical narratives and disrupt old ones.
2014	Many historians are cognizant of the relevance of relating past events to present day events and are trained to interpret and record these histories to make arguments.

2014	ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Many people helped to make this dissertation a reality and deserve special thanks.
2014	First, I am deeply indebted to my advisor and dissertation chair, Margaret Hedstrom, whose feedback, council, and support throughout my time at the School of Information were indispensible in my development as a researcher.
2014	As I reflect on the distance between my earliest dissertation ideas and the document you see before you, I am particularly grateful to Margaret for her incisive critique throughout the dissertation process.
2014	Elizabeth Yakel has also been an encouraging source of advice and mentorship over the last several years.
2014	I also thank the other members of my committee—George Alter and Carl Lagoze—for their support of my work and generosity in providing me with insights and new perspectives for the design of my study and analysis of my findings.
2014	Additionally, I would like to thank Ann Zimmerman, who served on my committee during the proposal phase and helped me greatly in shaping the study.
2014	The feedback and camaraderie of fellow students—both at the School of Information and at other schools—helped me develop my ideas and writing as well as provided a much-needed outlet for the ups and downs of graduate school.
2014	In particular, I need to thank Amelia Acker, Matt Burton, Eric Cook, Morgan Daniels, Kathleen Fear, and Ricky Punzalan.
2014	You all not only made graduate school a heck of a lot more fun, but you also generously offered astute critique of my work.
2014	Of course, my family and friends have been there every step of the way in this long process, giving me encouragement and helping me maintain a healthy sense of perspective.
2014	Mom, Dad, Pat, Mike, Sonya, John, Desmond, Krista, Daniel, Jaylen, Jesse, Noah, Eli, Joel, Abbey, Heather, Erin, and Janet: I cannot thank you all enough.
2014	I must give special credit to my  iii   mom, who instilled in me a lifelong love of knowledge and learning.
2014	My husband, Devon, was always an especially patient and reassuring presence, lifting me up when I felt discouraged and providing respite and joy when I needed it most.
2014	"Thank you" does not begin to cover how much it has meant for you to do this with me, Devon.
2014	Lastly, this study would not have been possible without the participation of the Station and the scientists in the three teams I studied.
2014	Scientists and staff were open, tolerant of my strange questions, and patient with me constantly looking over their shoulders.
2014	Furthermore, they made data gathering thoroughly enjoyable as they welcomed me into the Station community.
2014	I also acknowledge the financial support of the National Science Foundation IGERT-09036291 (OpenData), the Station, and the University of Michigan Rackham Graduate School.

2014	of local resources in college and university libraries.
2014	Using an approach combining basic- and applied research, the study represents the most comprehensive investigation of local resources in academic libraries so far.
2014	Both quantitative and qualitative data was collected by way of two survey questionnaires, plus observational visits to a small number of libraries, learning centres and Special Collections departments.
2014	In addition, interviews were conducted with local studies’ experts, collection managers, educators, and students.
2014	Secondary literature focusing principally on both local studies and academic libraries was also consulted.
2014	The study found that, while the literature, as well as ‘tradition’ tends to equate local studies and its resources with the public library, local material could be found in a majority of respondents’ collections.
2014	It is suggested that the relative neglect afforded local collections outside of the public sector is unwarranted, particularly when considering the potential for wider access to material that a more inclusive approach to local resources might allow for.
2014	The research also noted that the term ‘local’, as defined by the geographical scope of the material held in different collections, is open to significantly diverse interpretations, ranging from the college or university campus itself to one or more constituent countries (for instance, England and Wales).
2014	While some authors have addressed the complexity of defining ‘local’, the issue remains largely underexamined in the literature, where the term can frequently be based on little more than a tacit understanding of what ‘local’ means in any given context.

2014	The demonstration videos from the 2011 ICF and the programmes would receive the knowledge from NLW through metadata writing and digitisation.
2014	Furthermore, this sample of work was considered appropriate and achievable within the time constraints.
2014	This research had limitations placed upon it by:   The time allowed for the project (October 2012-December 2013),    The budget available,    The boundaries of the subject area,    The availability of technology,    The CCA being part of a larger institution, Aberystwyth University,    What digitisation activities could be done within the allowed time in consideration of student availability, and    Compliance with Aberystwyth University’s guidelines for conducting and submitting MPhil work.
2014	It was recognised when the scholarship was granted that there would be gaps in background knowledge in one or more project areas of the chosen candidate.
2014	This was addressed by undertaking work experience at NLW, attending digitisation
2014	ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The creation of a work of scholarship is a highly collaborative process, and as is the case with every monograph, dissertation, or thesis, this Master‟s thesis could not have been written without the assistance of several key figures along the way.
2014	Renee Jones and the staff of the St. Louis Public Library Archives were immensely helpful, providing friendly guidance, advice, and professionalism without which the necessary information could not have been obtained.
2014	They truly did, and continue to do, the lasting legacy of Frederick Crunden, Arthur Bostwick, their administrative descendents and librarianship in general, a great service.
2014	Ann Marie Wieland is another such figure, whose assistance with the collection of materials relating to Effie Power and her initial years of librarianship at the Cleveland Public Library proved to be a great help in terms of shaping her story and how she helped the St. Louis Public Library to serve children as well as adults.
2014	Again, she is one of many who continue to make librarianship the important profession it is.
2014	I would also like to thank the professors who have played a significant role in my development as a scholar up to this point, namely Drs.
2014	Abel Alves, Sviatoslav Dmitriev, Scott Stephan, Jonathan Bean, Holly Hurlburt, Peter Argersinger, and Robbie Lieberman, whose advice and guidance have helped me to become a better researcher and writer.
2014	Last but not least, I would like to thank my friends and family, who have encouraged and inspired me to keep going even when things were at their darkest.
2014	Thank you all.

2014	Despite the ubiquity of this mobile communication format, text messages are deleted, lost or overwritten at staggering rates by users and mobile operating systems.
2014	Mobile traces such as text messages currently fall outside of institutional digital archives as well as personal digital collections.
2014	This dissertation demonstrates how the infrastructure of mobile communication, including transmission protocol and the stabilization of the format, is integral to the curation, future access, and preservation of mobile communication at the personal and institutional levels of collecting.
2014	The dissertation examines the development of SMS by contextualizing the research need for the study of mobile information objects in information science by presenting the importance of layers of infrastructure to the creation and circulation of born-digital records transmitted across wireless networks.
2014	It applies a research framework for studying new information communication technologies and emerging electronic records contexts.
2014	The framework has three elements: (1) Layers of Infrastructure and Context, (2) Examining Networked Recordkeeping, and (3) Engaging with Information Retrieval.
2014	Using techniques from infrastructure studies and media archaeology, it illustrates how the text message as a digital format has been enacted by the mobile operating system on mobile phones.
2014	In turn, it shows how the text message format structures mobile communication over time in different contexts of creation and collection.
2014	It also highlights how the format is enacted in a mobile operating system: how text messages are stored on device hardware such as flash memory, and in various end-uses such as deletion and in

2014	This research would have been impossible without the support of my participants.
2014	Each one of them generously and anonymously donated their time for the benefit of my education.
2014	My parents provided catering and babysitting services, on top of endowing me with the confidence, intellectual curiosity, and perseverance necessary to pursue and complete a Ph.D. My wife Monena was incredibly supportive, allowing me to selfishly pursue this goal for eight years.
2014	In the final year she took on much more than her share of parenting our children and managing our household while also pursuing her own professional career.

2014	ACKNOWLEDGMENTS While there are many people to thank, I must first express my deepest appreciation to my major professor, Dr. Marcia A. Mardis, who is not only a fantastic researcher, but also a wonderful person.
2014	She knew when and how much to push me, and always had an encouragement to offer whenever I was “all loosey goosey.” I could not have made it to this point without her guidance, wisdom, and support, and I am forever grateful to her for everything she has done for me.
2014	In addition to Dr. Mardis, I must thank the members of my committee: Dr. Michelle Kazmer, Dr. Don Latham, and Dr. Juliann Woods.
2014	I bonded with Dr. Kazmer after she taught me the phases of theory development, and her insights and energy have been invaluable to me in completing my dissertation.
2014	I am indebted to Dr. Latham, whose keen eye and masterful phrasing have helped me put a bright polish on my prose.
2014	I truly appreciate Dr. Woods for her adaptability and genuine interest in my work.

2014	I would be remiss if I did not also acknowledge my friends who have been so supportive of me throughout this process: Sharon, who has been there for me since before the beginning; Mitchell, who was possibly even more excited about my impending “Ph.D.-ness” than I; Sergio and Dennis for loads of laughs and tons of food; Jack and Thomas for many a spirited Mario Kart race; and The Breakfast Club, whom I will never forget.
2014	Special thanks to Nicole for her amazing proofreading skills and countless conversations over lunch.
2014	Extra special thanks to the one true Jen for providing confirmability, if not reliability.

2014	ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
2014	from the local community college, Ms. Henning2 is responsible for federally mandated GED/ABE prep and general literacy courses.
2014	She volunteers her time to the group, and book purchases for the group are made entirely through trust fund-managed donations.
2014	In fact, many changes had occurred within the prison since my last visits in late 2003.
2014	Most relevant to this discussion is that certified librarians are no longer on the Department of Corrections (DOC) payroll, and no longer make periodic visits to the institution.
2014	The library is now supervised by Recreational Activities Specialists, who share their time between the library, the gym, and the art room.
2014	The library tasks (circulation, cataloging, book repair) are actually performed by Library Clerks, offenders who have earned status to obtain one of the most coveted jobs in the institution, earning around 43 cents an hour.
2014	I remember the eagerness I felt in my first return to the book group.
2014	Student colleagues asked me if I felt nervous to be in such close quarters with convicted felons.
2014	Surprising even myself, I answered “no”.
2014	Of course there is the anxiety of entering a social gathering as “the newcomer,” and perhaps additional butterflies from considering that I am one of only two women in the room, but their criminal histories have little effect on my nerves.
2014	I know that this particular group of men is self-selected.
2014	They receive no tangible rewards for participation, other than the monthly opportunity to engage in a reading experience and informal discussion with their peers.
2014	Such opportunities for discussions (especially on topics outside their own experience-related rehabilitation) are scarce in the routines of institutional life.
2014	From my very first visit, it has been clear to me  2  Not her true name.

2014	Dedication and acknowledgements
2014	ACKNOWLEGEMENTS  It’s been a long, wild ride.
2014	It’s been a ride that has never once been lonely.
2014	Many, many people have been there with me on the path leading up to and through this moment, and I’d like to express my tremendous gratitude to all of you.
2014	I’m going to try to start at the beginning and catch everyone who has helped and encouraged me along the way.
2014	I am going to follow in my committee chair’s footsteps a little here and thank the most important person first: Joseph Dennis Ryan.
2014	I don’t know where to start except to say that he has been the most incredible partner imaginable.
2014	His unwavering strength, resilience, support, patience, kindness, love, compassion, humor, prodding, encouragement, and well, everything he’s done for me in these past years have helped me get to where I am now.
2014	I honestly don’t know if I could have done it without him.
2014	I had many wonderful teachers in high school.
2014	Three have stayed with me over all of these years.
2014	First, was Dr. B, or Dr. Bishop.
2014	She asked a lot of her students, but was always kind and exceptionally supportive.
2014	It is in part because of her that I have such a love of literature, writing, and critical thinking today.
2014	She passed away the year after I took her class, but I am still influenced by her joy and passion for knowledge and teaching.
2014	The second is Raul Dorn.
2014	There was some special kind of magic that happened in his art classes that I’ve never known since.
2014	We were a tight-knit group of misfits back then, but this smart, kooky guy made us feel like we were part of something, like we belonged, like we could make wonderful things happen.
2014	The third is Jim Smith.
2014	He taught AP History, my first seminar vi       class, where he asked us to really think about and question everything around us.
2014	He also exhibited a true joy for teaching that serves as a model for my teaching today.
2014	In my years as an undergrad student at New Mexico State University, one professor shines the brightest as having a profound effect on my belief in myself and on the direction my life took after meeting him: Dr. Alvin Keaton.
2014	I have to speak somewhat more at length about him now; first because he made such a difference in my life, and second because he passed away just a few weeks ago.
2014	One of the first things he taught me was that the best way to learn something is to teach it.
2014	In his philosophy class, he excused the students from taking all future exams who made the top grades on his first exam, with the stipulation that they would serve as exam tutors for the rest of the semester.
2014	I was one of these “lucky” tutors, but of course, I had to study ten times harder to be a tutor than I ever did to take exams.
2014	But this was just the beginning of my relationship with Dr. Keaton.
2014	I used to meet with him and my then boyfriend, Cassidy King, for breakfast every Friday.
2014	He would buy us breakfast and we would talk endlessly about philosophy, science, and life.
2014	At these breakfasts he would often look at me and, shaking his head, ask me why I wasn’t achieving more, why I wasn’t living up to my potential.
2014	Before Al Keaton, I can honestly say that I didn’t believe I had much potential beyond working menial jobs and being a “starving artist.” I knew I was wildly curious about the world and was constantly thinking about how everything worked and fit together; but I had never had an outlet for these thoughts, and I had never received validation from the external world that the things I think and care about were actually worth a damn.
2014	It was from those moments with Al that the first sparks were ignited that propelled me to where I am today.
2014	The last time I had any real interaction with him, I was headed off to Houston, my first time living away from my hometown.
2014	He gave me $20 and told me to read Kevin       vii   Kelly’s Out of Control, both of which had a big impact on me.
2014	As soon as I got to Houston, I found and devoured a copy of Out of Control.
2014	It left me with a sense that I wasn’t quite as alone in my thinking as I thought.
2014	After living in a desert, both literally and figuratively, it was like a long, cool drink of water.
2014	Years after my last encounter with Al, I found myself exploring digital preservation as a masters student at the University of Denver.
2014	In my studies, I stumbled across Time & Bits: Managing Digital Continuity, a book about a collaborative conversation between members of the Getty Conservation Institute, the Getty Information Institute, and the Long Now Foundation.
2014	I read the book, and lo and behold, there was Kevin Kelly again.
2014	And there was Long Now, and they were accepting members.
2014	As soon as I could scrounge together enough money for the membership dues, I joined.
2014	Not too long after, I flew out to San Francisco for a Brian Eno art exhibit they were hosting, where I met and talked to Kevin Kelly about my research.
2014	After a short conversation with him and Alexander Rose, we agreed that I would do my master’s practicum with them that following summer.
2014	It’s a bit of a long story, but suffice it to say that the people of Long Now have had a big impact on my research.
2014	In particular, Alexander Rose, Laura Welcher, and Kurt Bollacker (one of my committee members, whom I will talk more about later) have all been tremendously gracious and supportive of me.
2014	I would also like to acknowledge my long-time friend, Richard Mortimer Humphrey, for supporting my goals and hosting me in San Francisco while I worked with Long Now.
2014	During my master’s program at the University of Denver, I had two advisors who supported me in my digital preservation research: Dr. Denise Anthony and Dr. Rich Gazan.
2014	It was in Rich’s classes that I first realized that I wanted to get my Ph.D. Denise has been my unfailing advocate from when she was first my advisor to today.
2014	viii   While many of my friends were not directly involved with my research, they were all wonderful to and supportive of me as I worked toward my goal of getting my Ph.D. First, I’d like to mention one of my oldest friends, Rowan Russell.
2014	In Colorado, the most notable of my support-team friends were: Radovan Anzulovic, Matthew Brown, Andrea Davis, Nancy Dituri, Michael Doherty, Donna Goben, Hayley Helmericks, Jaime Jennings, Tara Leedom, Mark Phillips, Julie Rockwell, Amanda Rybin, Doug Spencer, Carissa Sullivan, Katie Thomas, and Zarin Xavier.
2014	Of these people, I would like to give extra acknowledgement to Donna Goben, my new honorary sister.
2014	In North Carolina, my most notable supporters were: Earl Bailey, Mike Brown, Michelle Corbin, Josh Hockensmith, Erin Kawamata, Kelly Marks, Renee McBride, Margarite Nathe, Ericka Patillo, Rachel Powers, Terrell Russell, Mike Sonnichsen, Liz Wing, and Kam Woods.
2014	Of these people I would like to particularly thank Margarite Nathe and Josh Hockensmith for boosting my spirits every week at game night, camping and beach trips together, and for being the best damn wedding helpers a lady could ask for.
2014	I’d also like to thank Earl Bailey and Michelle Corbin for introducing us to the fantastic world of “Euro” games, all of the shared meals, and for being family.
2014	I’d also like to thank Mike Brown for all of the support and encouragement he gave me during his brief stint as my writing coach.
2014	I’d also like to thank all of my friends on Facebook from all over the world who cheered me on when I most needed it.
2014	Last, but not least of my friends, I’d like to acknowledge those doctoral student colleagues not already mentioned here.
2014	It’s been a long, wild ride for all of us.
2014	I’ve learned a little something from all of them and I am grateful for it.
2014	I wish them all the best and hope our paths cross again, preferably in less challenging circumstances.
2014	A great number of people at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of  ix
2014	ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS I would like to dedicate this dissertation to my grandson, Airic, who has always known me to be “working on a paper” and to my husband, Randy Cain, who has inspired and supported me in so many ways.
2014	I am also grateful to Kate Williams, who curated and made available the Technology Opportunities Program (TOP) project evaluations that served as my dataset; my committee chair, Linda Schamber, who encouraged me to keep pursuing my degree even when the going got really tough; Howard Rosenbaum, who knew me as a community networking champion before I dared dream of getting a Ph.D.; committee member Ruth West, who helped me follow my heart and obtain the data to finish the dissertation story I really wanted to write; and committee member Cornelia Caragea, who has inspired me to pursue the power of computing to analyze language in new ways.
2014	I would also like to extend a big thank you to Alice Robbin, who helped me learn to be “playful” with developing theory, exposed me to the vast literature relevant to community networking, and engaged me as the graduate student assistant for the Rob Kling Center for Social Informatics; Harmeet Sawhney, who helped me see big trends and included me on his team at The Information Society journal; my ex-husband who supported me for a big portion of my Ph.D. journey even when he didn’t understand it; Bill Moen, my boss at TxCDK of over five years, who brought me to Texas when I needed a major life change; Herman Totten, Dean of UNT’s College of Information, who never failed to ask about my dissertation progress; and many other friends, community and family members, colleagues, and acquaintances, who have inspired me in different ways and encouraged me to complete this degree.
2014	Finally, I’m grateful for my faith, which has sustained me throughout.

2014	THE REPLEVIN PROCESS IN GOVERNMENT ARCHIVES:
2014	ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Completing this doctoral dissertation has been one of the most significant academic challenges in my life.
2014	This would not have been possible without the love and support of a great many people, all of whom have nourished me academically, spiritually, or emotionally—I owe you all a debt of gratitude.
2014	In particular, I would like to thank Dr. Margaret Moore-West, who undertook the role of acting as my advisor and my committee chair.
2014	Despite her many other academic and professional commitments, she took me under her wing and believed in me when I struggled to believe in myself.
2014	Her wisdom, knowledge, and commitment to the highest standards inspired and motivated me.
2014	I would also like to thank Dr. Richard Abel, my dissertation committee member, for his leadership and mentorship.
2014	He accepted me into the doctoral program and has been extremely helpful to me in this process.
2014	I am also thankful for Dr. Sonal Kumar for taking time to read and guide my work.
2014	Donald Edge III, your love, support, and constant patience have taught me so much about sacrifice, discipline, and compromise.
2014	My mother, Theresa McDowell, who continually stressed the importance of education, supported me in times of need and made me realize how lucky I am to have had the opportunity to become educated.
2014	I would also like to thank my sister, nieces, and family—without them, this effort would have been worth nothing.
2014	Finally, I would like to thank all of my mentors, friends, and educational colleagues, whose help, guidance, and influence cannot be measured.
2014	vii
2014	ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Writing a thesis seems like a solitary task, but I could not have done it alone.
2014	This thesis would not be possible without the work of my committee.

2014	Because of him, my research and writing was more thoughtful.
2014	And my life has been more full.
2014	I am grateful to Vaughn Nuest for his unwavering support and love.
2014	While on my educational journey, I was in a family with and met a number of instrumental people who ushered me through the doors of education.
2014	There were some who sacrificed a great deal for my education, some who taught me to be passionate about learning for a greater good, and others who socialized me into academia and encouraged me to particulate in scholarly dialogue.
2014	Without these individuals, my educational journey would look vastly different.
2014	Thus, I am grateful to these people for opening up doors on my behalf.
2014	While I owe these individuals so much more, I attempt to thank them here.
2014	I am extremely grateful to the two unique and loving groups that have encouraged and supported my educational journey from my first day of preschool: the Taylor and Frye families.
2014	In fact, the pseudonyms I used for my participants are in honor of the matriarchs: Joy Elizabeth Taylor (“Izzie”), Virginia Ruth Cox Frye (“Ginger”), and Mary Lucille Woods (“Lucy”).
2014	You were my first teachers, and you lovingly shared your passions with me: reading, preserving stories, learning, and the art of performance.
2014	I have been the student of a great number of master teachers.
2014	They taught me the content of their subjects, showed me ways to steer my own learning, and served as examples of professionals who care.
2014	The best of you did all three.
2014	Thank you, Ms. Shingleton, JoAnn Price, Debra Nackenhorst, Leva Daniels, Carol Booth, Jill Gardiner, Marilyn Hall, Mr. Moulton, Jill Brunic, Mr. Taylor, Penny Kroening, David Thornton, Al Boehm, Nancy Johnson, Rick Swengel, Lyndon Wall, Jan Borradaile, Linda Burdine, Joan Ellis, Mike Slack, Anne Sanders, Dr. Jernigan, Dr. Ry Burke, Dr. Kovocik, Dr. Marvin, Betty Anderson, David Sabol, Tony Stamatoplos, Dr. Fox, Kelly Barnes, Mary Brown Nine, Anne-Elise Imwalle Smith, Janet Brown, Jeff Eaton, Chad Hyatt, Janet Pfadt, Craig Brinkman, Dr. Tilley, Dr. Callison, Dr. Irwin, Dr. Boyle-Baise, Dr. Flinders, Dr. Goodman, Dr. Dennis, Dr. Mason, Dr. Davis, Dr. Kunzman, Dr. Barton, and Dr. Hinderliter Ortloff.
2014	I want to acknowledge my friends who expanded my thinking about the world, the use of language, and the culture in which I was raised: Vaughn Nuest, Darcy Cross Wiley, David Sabol, Tony Stamatoplos, Micah Shires-Taylor, Carolyn A. Weber, Kylea Asher (Smith), David Smith, Rachel Vandivier Davidson, Beatriz Cuevas, Brad Wombles, Jathan Newton, Crystal Nivens, Amy Holmes, Joy Taylor Knight, Jennifer Cooper, Kelly Barnes, Shannon Gardiner, Mary Brown Nine, Setal Patel, Stephanie Good, Jeremy York, Holly McKenzie, Tony McGail, Eric McAfee, Geoff Jackson, Fernando Alonso Barrio, Deana Guido, Robin Moeller, Gabe Huddleston, Kyle Schnepp, Christine Yu, Gail Jean Gardiner, Donna Eder, David Duffy, Julie Pearson, Bruce Pearson, and Hank Swain.

2014	ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
2014	ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS So many people have helped me in so many ways along my path.
2014	It isn’t possible to thank them all here.
2014	Chances are good they know who they are, though, and will forgive any omissions here because they also know how absent-minded I can sometimes be.
2014	Obviously, I owe a tremendous debt to my advisor Cal (Christopher) Lee.
2014	He spent a great deal of time discussing and critiquing ideas, urging me onward, reading a few hideous first drafts, and pushing me to think (and therefore) write more clearly.
2014	I also owe a huge debt to my coadvisor Helen Tibbo, who has been a constant professional role model.
2014	I have benefited so much from her unrelenting honesty, her incisive and extensive knowledge of the profession, and her friendly help in every aspect of my degree program when I’ve needed it.
2014	I also want to thank the other members of my comprehensive exam committee and my dissertation committee, who have each provided helpful comments and critiques, and have offered professional insights along the way – Paul Jones, Richard Marciano, and Jeffrey Pomerantz from the School of Information and Library Science (SILS) at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill (UNC-CH) and Theresa A. Pardo from the Center for Technology and Government (CTG) at the University at Albany, the State University of New York (SUNY).
2014	I want to thank the interview respondents who took the time to discuss their workplace environments, concerns, and work objectives.
2014	I hope you keep in mind that this paper is not attempting to report “objective truths” about your organizations but rather, to highlight the perceptions which you have discussed so openly.
2014	vi   A large number of friends and colleagues have also provided help to me while writing this.
2014	I want to thank Amber Cushing and Sarah Ramdeen for some very early comments and critiques that helped me fine tune my ideas and better present them.
2014	I also want to thank the past and current members of the Curation and Archives Research Group at SILS.
2014	I received a number of excellent comments and questions from the members of this group during the various presentations and discussions we had.
2014	In addition, I want to extend a huge thank you to the SILS administrative folks who have provided excellent services along the way – Lara Bailey, Tammy Cox, Kaitlyn Murphy, Susan Sylvester, Shaundria Williams, and others too numerous to mention!
2014	And of course, thank you to Barbara Wildemuth and Gary Marchionini, who taught my first class in the Ph.D. program at SILS and who now perform so many administrative and academic duties to help students succeed that it boggles my mind.
2014	I want to thank two very good friends who have provided moral support, intellectual aid, and good humor along the way – Jewel Ward and Carolyn Hank.
2014	I couldn’t have done it without your advice, your jokes, and your willingness to listen to whining.
2014	Carolyn, I decided finally to write my own acknowledgments instead of just using yours.
2014	Your parents are undoubtedly great, but if I used your acknowledgments *you* wouldn’t have been in them!
2014	Jewel, thank you for keeping me going when things seemed dark and thank you for rushing to Hillsborough to be my witness on the morning Garnet and I decided to just go get married.
2014	I want to thank my very patient, very loving (and did I mention very patient?)
2014	family – Garnet Bornn, Jennifer Ryden, Christopher Nayar, and Jay Eakin.
2014	They put up with the days I could do nothing but write and the days that I couldn’t write to defend myself.
2014	They offered support, made sarcastic comments when necessary (and funny), and have always  vii   made not just my work, but my entire life, brighter for their being in it.
2014	Garnet - thank you for coming back into my life.
2014	You are my best friend and my true love.
2014	Luna, Chris, and Jay – I love you and am so proud of you!
2014	Thank you for putting up with me!
2014	And of course, thank you Bootsie, Jimoa, Hobo, Saber, Matches, and Butters who gave me lots of furry love these past years.
2014	Finally, I want to thank my dear, departed friend and boss Joe Fuhrig from my Golden Gate University days.
2014	I haven’t followed directly in your path but I have learned so many lessons from you about the ways the market can work when founded on ethical behavior, about the nature of dedication and the pursuit of knowledge, and about sticking to your fundamental beliefs even when no one else accepts them.
2014	You never gave up and you never gave in.
2014	I miss you, and think of you often.

2014	tasks.
2014	In the information seeking and retrieval environment, the task can be as simple as factfinding or a known-item search, or as complex as exploratory search.
2014	Given the complex nature of the information needs, exploratory searches may require the collaboration among multiple people who share the same search goal.
2014	For instance, students may work together to search for information in a collaborative course project; friends may search together while planning a vacation.
2014	There are demands for collaborative search systems that could support this new format of search (Morris, 2013).
2014	Despite the recognized importance of understanding search process for designing successful search system (Bates, 1990; Hearst, 2009), it is particularly difficult to study collaborative search process because of the complex interactions involved.
2014	In this dissertation, I propose and demonstrate a framework of investigating search processes in the collaborative exploratory search.
2014	I designed a laboratory-based user study to collect the data, compared two search conditions: individual search and collaborative search as well as two task types through the study.
2014	I first applied a novel Hidden Markov Model approach to analyze the search states in the collaborative search process, the results of which provide a holistic picture of the collaborative search process.
2014	I then investigated two important components in the collaborative search process – query behaviors and communications.
2014	The findings reveal
2015	would also like to recognize the members of my research committee – Professors Joi Moore,
2015	ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS  Firstly I would like to thank my dissertation committee for the time and effort that they spent during this project.
2015	My committee chair, Dr. Jaime Lester, officially joined the Higher Education Program the same semester as I did (Spring 2008).
2015	Enrolling in her Research Writing class that semester was one of the best academic decisions that I have ever made.
2015	Thank you for challenging me to take the more difficult route throughout both the MAIS and DA programs.
2015	It is likely that I would not even have considered the doctoral path without your support and encouragement.
2015	I hope that my future accomplishments in the academy reflect well on you as a scholar and a mentor.
2015	Dr. Jan Arminio- In addition to the valued methodological and compositional feedback, thank you for your support with all matters advising and interactions with the College.
2015	I am grateful that you supported my cause with the College.
2015	I hope that my academic productivity whilst in the program has represented you and the Higher Education Program well.
2015	Dr. Todd Rose- I thoroughly enjoyed your classes and the work we did during independent studies.
2015	It allowed me to approach problems from the unique analytical position that I tend to occupy in both the academic and professional realms.
2015	I will always appreciate the alternative academic perspectives that you provide and generate in your students.
2015	There also has been much supplemental support throughout this journey.
2015	Thank you to my supervisors, Mr. LeRoy LaFleur, Ms. Jamie Coniglio, and Ms. Theresa Calcagno.
2015	Your flexibility has allowed me to complete this degree.
2015	Dr. Mark Kidd, Dr. John O’Connor, and Dr. Anne Kuhta all served as academic advisors and provided much needed academic and professional guidance during my time in both degree programs.
2015	Master Jun An and the rest of my fight team offered me a physical outlet that facilitated the navigation of the most trying of mental days.
2015	My mom, Dr. Marie Perini, set the academic bar very high but she supported my chase in every way imaginable.
2015	The discipline instilled by my dad, Mr. Richard Perini, allowed me to realize my potential.
2015	Since I was a little kid on the soccer fields in Holland I have been trying to score as many actual and metaphorical goals as possible to impress  iv   you and make you proud.
2015	Above all, I now hope that who I am now as a person brings you the most fulfillment.
2015	Finally, and most importantly, I want to thank my wife, Lauren.
2015	We are finally finished (though perhaps a D.Litt.
2015	would round out my CV and I think I could get my body back together for just one more run at another world championship).
2015	This is just as much your achievement as it is mine.
2015	You have been with me from the start, as I chased championships and degrees and endured all the challenges that emerged along the way.
2015	You have given me peace and balance amidst all of my chaotic ambitions.
2015	It has been the greatest honor and privilege of my life to be your husband.
2015	I am anxious about the massive and rapidly forthcoming change in our lives but I am excited for what awaits us as a family.
2015	We have traveled far on many journeys; the adventures that lie ahead will be the greatest of them all.
2015	On to the next mountain…  v
2015	ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Upon reflection on my road to complete my dissertation, I have realized that I have had so many supporters, mentors and champions on my long journey.
2015	I really appreciate all of your warm hearts for me.
2015	I especially offer my sincere thanks to Dr. Nancy Everhart, who led me to success.
2015	She showed me an entirely different world of research, and willingly shared her wisdom to solve many problems that I encountered.
2015	Without her encouragement, I could not have completed this process with this sense of triumph.
2015	Also, I was able to truly share in the bounty of my doctoral committee members.
2015	Dr. Don Latham was very generous with his time, helping me to develop the content and style of my dissertation.
2015	Dr. Kathleen Burnett was a great leader who helped me set my research direction.
2015	I will never forget Dr. Vanessa Dennen’s passion and enthusiasm toward students’ success.
2015	The experience that I gained from her research group has been a foundation for my research.

2015	They have provided a rich soil of research and allowed me to grow healthy and strong with their affection and support.
2015	I’ve learned a lot from Professor Ken Armstrong and FSU's Program in Interdisciplinary Computing team, not only about teaching skills, but also having a positive attitude toward innovations.
2015	I am extremely grateful to all my iSchool friends for their help.
2015	The friends and colleagues who I met during the program became my lighthouse.
2015	Whenever I lost my direction, they were always there to illuminate my way home.
2015	A chat with my cohorts—Jon, Julia, Laura, Lisandra, Lynnsey and MinSook—was always a special source of care and healing.
2015	I express my deepest gratitude to the friends I gained from in the Education Department for your their supportive advice.
2015	The help from my Mommy-Long-Legs, Jennifer, is unforgettable.
2015	Also, thanks for the unwavering support I received from my friends in Korea, including Ssuk, Hui, Sun, Eunmi, my Chamkkae bros, and my former colleagues at LG Sangnam Library and Sungkyunkwan University.
2015	I cannot finish the acknowledgements without mentioning how much I love my family.
2015	The love from all of you to the (very) firstborn child makes the impossible possible.
2015	Most especially, my love and gratitude goes to my eternal helper and soul mate, my hubby!
2015	You made my unrealistically sublime dream real.
2015	Thank you for always being my man and encouraging me to go forward.
2015	(I know, Claire you are reading this to find your name!)
2015	Without the happiness and joyfulness that my bright Claire has brought into my life, I would not keep smiling.
2015	Mom and Dad, you are the source of my curiosity and energy.
2015	I still remember those nights when you taught me while working.
2015	I’m so proud that you are my parents.
2015	Finally, my Lord God, thank you for allowing me to be your gift and filling my heart and mind with a spirit of gratitude.

2015	ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Any historian is indebted to those whose work preserving the past enables his own research.
2015	Rheba Palmer Hoffman captured in 1955 events within living memory that, 60 years on, have escaped the written record, and Elizabeth Gritter’s interviews of key figures in Memphis history will serve historians for many generations to come.
2015	The scholars whose work is cited in this thesis have illuminated my understanding o f the library’s place in Memphis far more than the bare records o f the library could have.
2015	It continues to astound me that our middle-sized city has produced such a robust historiography.
2015	Much credit belongs to the steadfast members o f the Tennessee Historical Society and the West Tennessee Historical Society, whose dedication to publishing the history o f our city has been vital to our profession.
2015	For this particular project, I have been ably assisted by librarians and staff including Ed Frank and Brigette Billeaudeaux at the University o f Memphis Mississippi Valley Collection, Jan Stone at the University o f Memphis Law Library, and especially Wayne Dowdy and Chip Holliday at the Memphis Public Library and Information Center.
2015	Their patient explanation and excavation o f the archives made this research possible.
2015	A word o f thanks is also due to the unnamed souls working in acquisitions and cataloging who provided unmediated access to the monographs upon which I relied so heavily, and to those who digitized important documents for both libraries’ institutional repositories.
2015	I am also grateful to my advisor, Dr. Aram Goudsouzian, for his patient guidance, useful pointers, and careful proofreading, and to my committee members, Drs.
2015	Beverly Bond and Sarah Potter, for their helpful suggestions to bring this thesis to its final state.
2015	Small portions o f this thesis were written for papers submitted to Dr. Potter and to Dr. Andrew Daily for earlier coursework.

2015	ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS It is often said that it takes a village to raise a child.
2015	In my case, this applied to my doctoral studies.
2015	To name everyone who contributed in some way to this dissertation would take a document as long as the study itself.
2015	That said there are a number of individuals who deserve to be singled-out here for their contributions to this work.
2015	Firstly, my doctoral adviser Dr. Mega Subramaniam has been an incredible mentor over the years.
2015	Her patience, guidance through academia, and knowledge of research have been invaluable to my successful completion of the program.
2015	Likewise, my honorary second adviser, Dr. Paul Jaeger, has treated me like a colleague over the years, and I have learned an incalucuable amount of knowledge of the profession because of this.
2015	Mega and Paul often acted as a tag team of coach and cheerleader, and without their support I would not have had nearly the successes that I have had over the years.
2015	In addition to my advisers, this research could not have been done without the dedicated librarians and students who participated in the study.
2015	I also had the help of Dr. Beth St. Jean throughout the project, who offered invaluable career and editing advice, meticulous field notes that were an asset to the data analysis, and enjoyable conversations in traffic en route to the many after-school sessions we led.
2015	Additionally, I had the support of an incredible research team including Rebecca Follman, Christie Kodama, and Faith Ambrosini.
2015	iii   The other members of my committee, Dr. Ann Weeks and Dr. Irwin Morris have been supportive of my work and always willing to offer advice and feedback.
2015	I also had the support of a more informal network of fellow students at UMD, including Ursula Gorham, Kaitlin Peterson, Brian Real, and Amanda Waugh.
2015	Also from the College, Dr. John Bertot and Dr. Ping Wang have been generous with their time and expertise, offering research advice, opportunities for scholarships, and general support throughout my doctoral program.
2015	Outside of my program, I have been lucky enough to have a strong support network of mentors, friends, and family.
2015	Dr. Karen O’Connor and Dr. Richard Cupitt offered invaluable support in my early forays into academia.
2015	My friends, particularly Jen Kirk, Jon Weakly, Ted Crocker, and Malorie Garrett were gracious about my years-long descent into the dissertation and reminded me that I would actually have a social life someday.
2015	My brother, Nicholas Greene taught me how to construct an argument and gave me the musical education I needed to compile my 2000s Hip Hop playlist (essential to the writing process!)
2015	My grandpartents offered gentle nudges to finish so I could move closer and other extended family members gave me ample opportunities to try to explain what it is exactly that I research.
2015	My parents, Debbie and Matthew Greene gave me the mix of education, love, care, and reading materials that is necessary for true success.
2015	Leroy and Molly offered humor and snuggles, as well as reminders not to forget the important things in life (cookies and fishies?)
2015	And finally, my husband, Brian, offered endless patience, love, and support, and is a constant daily reminder of how lucky I am.

2015	Acknowledgements
2015	ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS I would like to extend my warmest appreciation to the many people who encouraged me and assisted me throughout this process.
2015	Writing the thesis has been one of the greatest endeavors of my life and I could not have succeeded without the following people.
2015	I would like to thank the staff at the California State Library and State Archives.
2015	I would also like to thank the reference staff at Santa Cruz Public Library for helping find the many local resources necessary for completing my research.
2015	The reference staff at Watsonville Public Library were most helpful and supportive in the best of ways.
2015	Reagan Huerta from the Pajaro Valley Historical Society was especially helpful in finding local Watsonville history sources including information regarding the Watsonville Public Library.
2015	I would like to thank my thesis committee members Sharyn Schwab and Kristen Rebmann for their keen eye and overall support.

2015	Lastly, I would like to give deep gratitude to my wife Watonka and my two sons Braelen and Skyler for standing by me through thick and thin while I spent over a year of my life dedicated to this project.
2015	v
2015	ACKNOWLEDGMENTS It takes a village to support any serious research undertaking, and this project is no exception.
2015	The obvious place to start in giving thanks is to my dissertation committee, who provided support, encouragement, and advice throughout the process.
2015	Each member of my committee gave incredibly helpful feedback, and was vital to the dissertation writing process.
2015	I feel incredibly fortunate to have the advisor and committee members I do.
2015	My department has also been an important provider of many different kinds of support, from the encouragement and thoughtful questions from peers in classes and at my defense, to the support of graduate assistantships and scholarships that gave me the ability to finance my education.
2015	Florida State University is home to some of the greatest scholars I know, and through my time at the School of Information, is now home to many treasured friends as well.
2015	My colleagues elsewhere, including faculty, students, and librarians, deserve praise as well, for continued encouragement and for the valuable insights they have shared throughout the research process.
2015	I also would like to thank the various libraries I consulted during my research (the New York Public Library system, Municipal Archives, Columbia University Library, University of Massachusetts Amherst) and the Florida State University libraries, and the wonderful people who work at them, who were a pivotal part of this project’s success.
2015	Many (many!)
2015	people beyond my professional life have also supported my work.
2015	My family has been a constant source of encouragement throughout my doctoral  iv   program, and without a lifetime of their love, support, and belief in me, there is absolutely no way I would have grown into the person who believed in herself enough to begin a doctoral program in the first place.
2015	My friends have been instrumental in this program and in my life as well, giving me places to stay while I was in New York, plus lots of love and encouragement, and pulling me away from my computer once in a while to do something fun and to remind me that there is a world outside my dissertation.
2015	I feel incredibly fortunate to be surrounded by so many talented, loving, and amazing people.
2015	Thanks is due to Written?Kitten!, the program that motivated me to write through the promise of cat pictures.
2015	Finally, thanks is due to my pets, who puzzingly love me no matter what state of disarray my person or my home might be in.
2015	The following people deserve a special mention here, as well as my eternal gratitude: Melissa Gross, Richard Urban, Gary Burnett, Jennifer Koslow, Wayne Wiegand, Michelle Kazmer, Christie Koontz, Don Latham, Warren Allen, Paul Marty, Kathy Burnett, Marcia Mardis, Elaine Howard, Linda Ross, Shonda Sampson, Kimberly Amos-Tata, Jade Stagg, Cathy Branton, Pam Doffek, Leila Gibradze, Abby Philips, Jonathan Hollister, Jisue Lee, Wonchan Choi, Jongwook Lee, Jihei Kang, Lenese Colson, Dave Skinner, Margaret Meints, Jan Horton, Jean Sibbald, Tim Meints, Jonathan Horton, Jameson Horton, Jeremy Horton, William Skinner, Margery Skinner, Julian Huntley, Lauren Bradley, Elisa Rojas, Annie Pho, Nicole Fonsh, J.

2015	I am sure I have left more than a few names off this list.
2015	If I have overlooked yours, it is less a reflection of your level of support than a reflection of the state of my brain after writing this dissertation.

2015	Dawn Herd-Clark, Michelle Jones, Stacy Jones, lyanna Sims, Jahala Simuel, and Dr. Washella Simmons.
2015	I also would like to acknowledge my “big sisters” from Spelman College who have served as personal inspirations and mentors to me: Vera Jordan, Lorin Stewart, Kristy Rachal, and Dr. Stephanie Wright.
2015	Additionally, I would like to thank Sandra Phoenix, Executive Director o f the HBCU Library Alliance for her support and contribution to this project.
2015	Finally, I must acknowledge the many librarians who have and continue to labor at HBCU libraries, who often do much with very little and remain passionate and committed to the cause of educating students o f color.
2015	ACKNOW LEDGEMENTS I would like to thank my dissertation committee for their support throughout this project.
2015	I thank Jeannette Bastian for chairing the committee and guiding me through the doctoral program; Martha Mahard for the kindness she showed me; and Nancy McGovern for our many conversations even when they were not directly about this dissertation.

2015	ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS  I started the doctoral program in the Fall of 2011 with a clear idea of what I wanted to study – equitable access to legal information – because of two individuals who showed me time and time again that there is a “human” side to the law that often gets lost in the opinions and statutes we read in law school.
2015	During the years I spent working alongside Judge Lawrence F. Rodowsky (Maryland Court of Appeals) and Judge Paul Mannes (United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Maryland), I saw how they treated everyone who appeared before them with respect and compassion, taking the time to make sure that all parties understood what was happening at every stage of the case.
2015	And so the idea of exploring the intersection of access to justice and access to information took root long before I changed career paths.
2015	The decision to follow a different career path was not an easy one, and there are many people whose support along the way has been invaluable.
2015	Paul Jaeger, my advisor, set everything in motion.
2015	Since I added his Information Policy class at the last minute in the spring of 2007, Paul has been my teacher, my advisor, my mentor, my co-author, and so much more.
2015	With every challenge I have faced over the past few years, he has helped me to remain focused on what matters.
2015	The words “thank you” are inadequate but they will have to suffice.
2015	Each member of my committee – John Bertot, Beth St. Jean, Ann Weeks, and Irwin Morris – has been instrumental in shaping my dissertation.
2015	Many thanks to each of them for their thoughtful comments and questions.
2015	This study became a reality because of the support of Steve Anderson of the Maryland State Law Library, Liz Keith of Pro Bono Net, and their wonderful colleagues, as well as the legal services providers and librarians who participated in surveys and interviews.
2015	They all inspired me with their passion for and commitment to their work – it has been a privilege to tell their stories.
2015	I am also indebted to my colleagues at the College of Information Studies and Information Policy and Access Center – especially Natalie Greene Taylor, Diane Travis, Liz Larson, Brian Real, Amanda Waugh, Becca Oxley, and Ruth Lincoln.
2015	Thank you for the conversations about research, the impromptu therapy sessions, and – most of all – the many laughs.
2015	The past four years would not have been nearly as enjoyable without all of you, and I look forward to our paths crossing again in the future.
2015	On a personal note, I am so grateful to family and friends who have helped out in countless ways over the past few years.
2015	I would like to thank my parents, Peter and Ursula Gorham, for their unwavering love, support, advice and encouragement as I have found my way in this world.
2015	It is, however, my “three boys” to whom I owe the most.
2015	My husband, Tony, had enough faith to take this leap with me (and enough patience to  iii   deal with the moodiness that inevitably accompanies sleep deprivation).
2015	My sons, Joseph and Dillon, were actually the reason that I chose to go back to school at a time when our lives were already so very full.
2015	Neither of them will probably ever fully understand how much they have taught me about courage and resilience over the past eleven years.

2015	Professors in the Education Department and the Library Science Department of Sam Houston State University have significantly affected my ability to realize this aspiration through their excellent teaching skills and caring encouragement.
2015	First, my deepest appreciation goes to Dr. George Moore, my dissertation chairman, who shared his knowledge and served as one of the most encouraging figures during the writing of my dissertation.
2015	His positive encouragement throughout the process allowed me to increase the quality of my writing to meet the doctoral level.
2015	He consistently inspired and nurtured me throughout my doctoral experience and I will be forever grateful.
2015	My appreciation also goes to the other two members of my committee, Dr. Stacey Edmonson and Dr. Karin Perry, both of who gave their time and expertise in helping me with my dissertation.
2015	Also, I would like to thank the members of Cohort 26, my friends, Janie Flores, Jessica Lilly Hughes, Rebecca Novotny, Janie Pickett, and Melanie Wachsmann for sustaining me during classes and encouraging me throughout the doctoral process.
2015	The spirit, intelligence, and professional heights these women have achieved has moved and inspired me.
2015	I would like to thank my friends, The Round Mountain Girls, who were there when I needed to talk, but especially for those much needed breaks o f laughter and good times.
2015	Finally, I would like to specifically acknowledge and express my thankfulness to my wonderful husband, Terry, who believed and supported me from the first day that I expressed an interest in getting my doctorate.
2015	He sacrificed an enormous amount of time   that allowed me to achieve my goal.
2015	I share this degree with Terry, for without his unconditional love and sacrifice, it would not have been possible.
2015	I thank God for giving me Terry and the determination and strength to overcome obstacles and complete this task.

2015	iii
2015	ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS My life has been greatly enriched by scores o f wonderful people who supported me throughout my doctoral journey.
2015	I cannot imagine completing this journey without their love, friendship, mentorship, and support.
2015	I was especially blessed to have an awesome access to faculty members on my dissertation committee who shared their professional experiences and insights in support o f my study.
2015	Dr. Rebecca Bustamante, my committee chairperson, was a huge inspiration to me, never failing to lift my spirit and encourage me whenever I waivered.
2015	With fondness, I recall her high energy and engaging leadership during a university-sponsored trip to Costa Rica in 2012.
2015	Rather than allowing me to retreat behind my apprehensions on that trip, she compelled me, in a noncritical way, to confront them and to enjoy the journey.
2015	It was during this trip that I was drawn to her genuine and caring nature.
2015	Dr. Bustamante’s constant encouragement caused my qualms and fears during that trip to take flight.
2015	I also owe immense gratitude to my other committee members, Dr. Judith Nelson and Dr. Holly Weimar.
2015	I did not have a prior relationship with them, yet, they were willing to commit their time and expertise in developing my dissertation.
2015	They meticulously read through several drafts of my dissertation, offering valuable feedback with each pass.
2015	I will forever be grateful for their professional support.
2015	Throughout my doctoral journey, I encountered many wonderful professors who left a lasting impression on me.
2015	However, I would like to especially acknowledge Dr. Anthony J. Onwuegbuzie who taught several my doctoral courses.
2015	Dr. Onwuegbuzie consistently demonstrated a tremendous work ethic that was characterized as credibility, accountability and professionalism toward research and scholarship.
2015	Under his tutelage, I   had the opportunity to co-write and present with him and my doctoral cohorts at regional, national and international conferences.
2015	While I conducted my study, I appreciated the rigorous manner in which he taught his courses and his elevated expectation for professionalism.
2015	I am indebted to the veteran academic librarians for their enthusiasm and willingness to take part in my study.
2015	Their openness in sharing their experiences was regaling as I nostalgically listened to their early career experiences which were similar to my own.
2015	I am also very appreciative o f my transcriptionist, Jared McNeely, who is a graduate student at Stephen F. Austin State University.
2015	He delivered quality transcripts within the requested timeframe.
2015	My life has been tremendously enriched through the friendship formed with the doctoral students in Cohort 24.
2015	We laughed and cried together, studied together into the wee hours o f the morning, and missed time with our families in pursuit of a common goal.
2015	We often reminded each other that we had embarked on a bird by bird journey.
2015	We have formed a lifelong bond as friends and colleagues that I will always cherish.
2015	Cohort 24 rocks!
2015	Words cannot begin to express my eternal gratitude to my family.
2015	I want to express a special love and appreciation to my mother, Jessie Berry, who told me that I should seize the opportunity to begin this journey regardless o f my stage in life.
2015	She kept up with my progress throughout the doctoral journey, reminding me along the way that she was looking forward to the day when I would reach my goal.
2015	She believed in me and propelled me forward by elevating her expectations o f me.
2015	My mother, along with my four sisters and three brothers cheered me along the way, doing whatever I asked o f them to help me along the way.
2015	My father, Arthur L. Harrison, Sr., passed year and half before   my dream was realized.
2015	As an adult child, whenever I telephoned him, he would say to me, “I was just thinking about you.” And my heart would sing.
2015	My utmost heartfelt appreciation goes to my husband o f 40 years, Mark Dickerson.
2015	He supported me by providing me with the space and time to do whatever I needed to do.
2015	A man o f few words, he demonstrated his and love support in his actions.
2015	I appreciate the love and support o f our three adult children, Marcherie, Ashlee, and Aaron, and their spouses for believing in me.
2015	I want to thank our seven grandchildren for their loving, excited spirits for not thinking it strange that their Grandest was still a student.
2015	I knew they were watching me; therefore, my desire to succeed was greatly increased.
2015	Finally, I give honor to my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, for giving me the strength to make it across the finish line.
2015	He surrounded me with His circle o f love and protection and granted me unmerited favor throughout my doctoral journey.

2015	ACKNOWLEDGMENTS I am a blessed person who has met great teachers in my journey in academics.
2015	My sincerest gratitude goes to my major professor Dr. Besiki Stvilia for his great support throughout my Ph.D. course at Florida State University (FSU).
2015	He is a mentor of my life who has not only taught me how to research, but also shown me how much an advisor can mean to a student who is preparing his or her future in the Ph.D. program.
2015	When I get the opportunity to guide my own students in the future, I will always think back to the days I was under his mentorship and remind myself of how he guided me.
2015	My thanks also go to my other committee members, Dr. Kathleen Burnett, Dr. Lorraine Mon, and Dr. Neil Charness, for their support and insightful feedback, which have enabled me to complete my Ph.D. program including my dissertation project.
2015	It was such great luck to have them as my advisory committee in my Ph.D. program.
2015	I also would like to extend my appreciation to my professors at Pusan National University (PNU) in Korea.
2015	My special thanks go to Dr. Durk Hyun Chang, who was my advisor in the Master’s program at PNU, for his continuous support and encouragement.
2015	I thank my faculty, staff, and fellow doctoral students in the School of Information at FSU, as well as my friends outside of the school for their intellectual, emotional, and social support, without which I would have never been able to survive this long journey.
2015	My sincere gratitude goes to my research participants.
2015	They willingly spent their time with me, sharing their thoughts and experience regarding my research topic, which enabled me to answer my research questions in the dissertation project.
2015	Last but not least, my very special thanks go to my parents and family.

2015	several years earlier.
2015	There are now a number of platforms partnering with colleges and universities to produce MOOCs, but the most well-known are Coursera, EdX, and Udacity.
2015	There are several key differences between MOOCs and traditional online courses.
2015	The latter are, of course, usually not free and are only open to students of the college or university that produces them.
2015	Out of necessity, professors of MOOCs take a much less active role than those teaching traditional online courses.
2015	It is difficult to interact personally with thousands of students, even if the professor is always available when the class is being offered, and since MOOCs are designed and recorded ahead of time—unlike the live video lectures offered through some more traditional online courses—they can be offered over and over with identical content.
2015	In some ways this reusability is a good thing: after the initial investment of time and money to create the class, the upkeep costs are low, and students who are unable to take a course when it is first offered can rest secure in the knowledge that it will probably be offered again without worrying that the professor will be replaced with one less able or that the content will be different.
2015	On the other hand, this reusability also means that students miss out on the spontaneity of real-time lectures, the ability to ask the professor questions, and updates to the content based on advances in the field or current events.
2015	However, MOOCs do have at least two other advantages over traditional online courses.
2015	Firstly, their open enrollment policy provides students with more classmates and more diverse classmates than closed online courses.
2015	This means that students are statistically more likely to be able to connect with classmates online, as more students are likely to be on the forums at once,
2015	Acknowledgements
2015	ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This thesis project exists only due to the exceptional guidance and support given to me by my committee, colleagues, friends, and family.
2015	I am particularly grateful to Dr. Danny P. Wallace for his introduction to the world of research in library and information studies, kind and thoughtful advice at every stage in the process, and saying “you should do this” before I ever thought I could.
2015	My appreciation is extended to Steven D. Yates for being a thorough editor, always offering valuable feedback and advice, expertly helping me navigate through this project, and never doubting that it would be a success.
2015	I am indebted to Sybil Bullock for being so engaged with this undertaking, contributing countless insights into the nature of special library work, encouraging me generously, and being the ideal example of a special librarian.
2015	And thanks go to Dr. Emma Annette Wilson for her continuous enthusiasm, sincerity, and thoughtfulness regarding my research.
2015	I would also like to express my admiration and appreciation for the many special librarians, information professionals, and archivists who made this research possible by continuing to discuss what it means to be a part of the community of special libraries.
2015	Many thanks also go to my colleagues, fellow students, and friends who encouraged me throughout this process.
2015	I am extremely indebted to Dr. Kathryn Matheny, my sister, for being a methodical editor, thoughtful sounding board for ideas, and constant cheerleader.

2015	ACKNOWLEDGMENTS I could not have completed this dissertation without the considerable support of family members, friends, and colleagues.
2015	There were many times when I felt unable to see this task through, and I am profoundly grateful to everyone who helped me along the way.
2015	I entered the Graduate School of Library and Information Science in the fall of 2006 with the sole intention of earning a master’s degree, yet here I sit on the other side of a dissertation.
2015	I had the good fortune of working with Dan Schiller throughout.
2015	Were I to describe all the ways that Dan excels at his job as a scholar—as a researcher, writer, instructor, and mentor—I would not have room for anyone else in the acknowledgments.

2015	Finally, the dedication page reads “For Joe Cali.” Joseph John Cali was a long-time librarian at Antioch College, working there for 50+ years until his death in 2007; Joe literally worked for the library until the day he died.
2015	His passion for librarianship and the humanities inspired generations of Antiochians to become librarians themselves, or at least to engage more deeply with libraries and librarians.
2015	I attended a special memorial service held by the College shortly after he died, and his sister closed the eulogy by saying: “My brother’s life was not a life of the headlines.
2015	His was a life of the heart.” Joe, here is to living a life of the heart.

2015	Acknowledgments
2015	ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS I wish to thank several faculty members in Northeastern University’s English department, starting with Professor Chris Gallagher for directing this thesis and helping me transform a miniresearch study for a seminar into a larger scholarly inquiry about the dynamics of sponsorship.
2015	Chris’s ability to challenge and draw out aspects of my theorizations was complemented by his consistent support, patience, and generosity to lend his time; the benefits of having such a mentor are reflected throughout this thesis.
2015	I am grateful to Professor Mya Poe who, at the start of my graduate career, introduced me to the field of rhetoric and composition and inspired me to write the essay that shaped the work to come about sponsorship and collaboration.
2015	It was Mya’s astute suggestion to take the project to Chris that afforded my opportunity to examine the Woody Guthrie Manuscript Collection and discover the preliminary findings on which this thesis rests.
2015	I am also thankful for Professor Neal Lerner agreeing to be a reader when he barely knew my work, or me but liked Alan Lomax.
2015	His comments helped shaped my draft into a polished thesis.
2015	I also want to recognize Professor Elizabeth Dillon, who introduced me to the digital humanities, and Professor Ryan Cordell, who encouraged me to develop a digital project related to this thesis.
2015	I also wish to thank Todd Harvey at the Archive of American Folklife, Library of Congress, for being a resource and supporting my line of inquiry.
2015	ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS I also wanted to acknowledge the vast amount of energy and support of my friends, especially Jeremiah Nelson, Tim Carmichael, Robyn Mahoney, Robin Boswell, Deon Ritchie, Jackie Harper, Bill and Becky Bragdon, and Jon Finn.
2015	It is with great sadness that I realize that Finn will not be with us to celebrate this achievement.
2015	Your presence is missed every day, Finn.
2015	My many thanks go to my committee, Dr. Sam Hastings, Dr. Paul Solomon, and Dr. Lee Walker, as well.
2015	You guys are awesome.
2015	I greatly appreciate the words of advice and encouragement as this process has taken place.
2015	Your words of wisdom were always helpful and I greatly appreciate all of the work that you did for me.
2015	An unspeakable amount of thanks goes to Kendra Albright as my advisor.
2015	I could not have asked for a better advisor.
2015	Your advice and encouragement were always welcome and I cannot thank you enough for all the hard work that you put into this in order for me to achieve the level of excellence for which I was aiming.
2015	My gratitude also goes to the faculty and staff at the University of South Carolina.
2015	All of you have made what often seemed an insurmountable task into an achievable project.
2015	Finally, my thanks go to all of the doc students at USC, both new and former.
2015	Your friendship and support have helped me achieve what often seemed an unattainable goal.
2015	I hope that the idea of stone soup continues long after I am gone.

2015	ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS When I first started writing this dissertation I had written a small acknowledgement snippet featuring praise of Mountain Dew, videogames and rollerblading.
2015	It’s amusing how much we can transform in just a few years.
2015	I clearly owe my committee substantial thanks for their insightful feedback and guidance throughout the project, especially Linda Smith, who must have had the will of a titan to put up with all of my informality and rampant side projects.
2015	More importantly, I owe a lion’s share of gratitude to a whole network of people who kept me going along the way.
2015	To say they supported me would be too vague; I think I’d rather express my enrapturement in their outstanding belief that my strange hacking of scholarship, technology and activism actually had some merit to it.
2015	Many thanks are to be had.
2015	To Professor Mike Twidale for his cheery and perturbed fascinations with social-technical quandaries and his unending supply of almost spontaneous and simultaneously nonchalant but helpful wisdom.
2015	To Professor Kate Williams for her to-the-point challenges and forthright dedication to defining the field of community informatics.
2015	To Ann Bishop for being something of a role model for me by compassionately and proactively evoking her personal convictions in her professional life.
2015	To Linda Smith for providing the somehow amazingly appropriate balance of wisdom, knowledge, flexibility, common sense and warmth as a committee chair.
2015	To Lisa Bievenue and Informatics for letting me cultivate my dream job and bounce back and forth between public engagement and scholarship.
2015	And to GSLIS for being a department that is both gracious and an excellent place to tackle problems.
2015	To my friends and colleagues at the Fab Lab, who allowed me to direct and expound on my positivity and affinity for play.
2015	To Joel Spencer, Amber Cox (Castens) and all of the teens at The Urbana Free Library because they are an exemplar when it comes to fostering digital literacies.
2015	To my sister, parents and friends who pushed my work ethic and provided incentives.
2015	And finally, to all of the libraries and librarians all around the state who not only told me stories, but give of themselves continuously to powerfully promote and grow their communities.
2015	Thank you all.

2015	To my parents-in-law, Dong-man Shin and Sook-ja Kim, who always encouraged and supported me through their love and prayer.
2015	Most importantly, I’d like to recognize the invisible and invaluable support and patience of my husband, Hosop Shin.

2015	ix
2015	Despite being on my third page of acknowledgements already, I’m just getting to the
2015	knowledge production.
2015	In conducting these studies, an empirical framework is developed for analyzing different characteristics of a governance model.
2015	A number of concepts from sociotechnical systems development are also addressed, including the peering of provision and production activities in contemporary research settings, polycentric models of governance, and the emergence of new types of commons models, including the knowledge commons.
2015	The results of this dissertation demonstrate that analytical frameworks (similar to those used in socioecological systems) can produce reliable empirical data about sustainability in a sociotechnical realm.
2015	In turn this data can be used for a comparative study of sustainability in the sociotechnical systems used by contemporary science research and development.
2015	The results of this dissertation also hold a number of important implications for science and technology policy, including the efficacy of using a standardized framework in designing new governance models for cooperative research projects.

2016	Chris Schmid and Charles Licht at UWM Print and Copy Services have also been gracious and I additionally appreciate the support I received from Union Marketing.
2016	I also want to thank the Helen Bader Institute for Nonprofit Management for its important impact on my graduate education and the Department of Art History for the exciting and unusual opportunity to put on a thesis exhibition in pursuit of a Master’s of Arts.
2016	I am especially thankful for the generous financial support for the exhibition received through the Jeffrey R. Hayes Graduate Research Award administered by the Department of Art History and from Jan Serr and John Shannon.
2016	These contributions made the exhibition possible and gave me assurance that the project is meaningful.
2016	I am indebted to Thomas Ferrella for his unwavering commitment to the project, his willingness to create new work within the parameters of the exhibition, for collaborating like an old friend, for allowing me to get to know him, his family and friends and for permitting me to  vii   share his stories herein.
2016	Thank you also to Jenie Gao, James Barry and the others who have helped Ferrella prepare the installations on campus.

2016	Please never stop caring for this green earth.
2016	viii   Introduction Artists’ books in Special Collections at UW-Milwaukee Libraries and regional artist Thomas Ferrella share a story about a world we shape, that in turn shapes us.
2016	It is a story of beauty, growth and rejuvenation, but it is also a story about carelessness, disruption and loss.
2016	Through the lens of a self-taught artist and the perpetually avant-garde medium of book arts, this exhibition attempts to turn the page in the way we approach environmentalism; this page is on what shapes us.
2016	ECO Ephemeral temporarily distorts routines at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee (UWM) by marking the paths we traverse and by transforming the green spaces we cross.
2016	One who sets foot on the Kenwood Campus might walk on ephemeral hand painted names of endangered species, highlighting Ferrella’s intent to demonstrate how we impact our surroundings.
2016	Passing through Ferrella’s serpent-like sculptural installation along Downer Avenue prompts one to consider individual influences on the land.
2016	One might also appreciate a painting of Wisconsin wildlife before realizing that the seemingly ubiquitous species are all endangered.
2016	Students of life will also find their way to Special Collections on the fourth floor of Golda Meir Library to see one of UWM’s inspiring green solar rooftops and to browse intricate artists’ books that explore environmental considerations from divergent perspectives.
2016	The artists’ books included are by regional and internationally acclaimed artists Sarah Bryant, Julie Chen, Eddee Daniel, Fred Hagstrom, Karen Kunc, Denise Levertov and Claire Van Vliet, Regula Russelle and Jody Williams.
2016	This exhibition is nontraditional in that all but one of the works are touchable and none are housed in a gallery.
2016	Hopefully it succeeds in breaking the limitations of gallery installations of artists’ books by inviting viewers to experience the books in their entirety.
2016	For a few short  1

2016	ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This thesis would not have been possible without the advice and enthusiasm of my committee chair, Dr. Debra Hansen.
2016	I became interested in the topic of library services to blind readers after researching the National Library for the Blind and Physically Handicapped for a class on the history of books and libraries taught by Dr. Hansen and her colleague Dr. Linda Main.
2016	During the course of my research, I repeatedly came across the name of Kate Foley, home teacher of the blind in California, in primary sources.
2016	Dr. Hansen encouraged me to investigate Foley further as a potential topic for a master’s thesis and has provided unfailing support throughout the process.
2016	I would also like to thank Dr. Anthony Bernier and Elizabeth Wrenn-Estes for agreeing to serve as committee members and for taking the time to read this thesis and provide invaluable input.
2016	Finally, I would like to thank the helpful staff members at the California State Archives, the California History Room at the California State Library, and the Bancroft Library at the University of California, Berkeley.
2016	This project has given me a newfound appreciation and respect for archives and archivists and their essential role in the preservation of history.

2016	ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS: I owe a debt of gratitude to the many people that supported me while I wrote this dissertation.
2016	First and foremost I must thank my dissertation committee, including its Chair, Dr. Rebecca Conard.
2016	She carefully and patiently guided me through the steps necessary to complete this dissertation.
2016	In particular, she taught me to look beyond the obvious and dig deeper when examining sources and narratives.
2016	This dissertation is much stronger for that.
2016	The other members of my committee, Dr. Kelly Kolar, Dr. Elizabeth Dow, and Dr. James Beeby, all spent many hours reading and commenting on this text, subsequently providing suggestions and advice that greatly enriched the story I tell in the following pages.
2016	I also cannot express enough thanks to all my committee members for spending a great deal of time helping me edit my dissertation.
2016	Although writing requires discipline and adhering to a schedule, it also involves a great deal of fun and creativity.
2016	Editing has a certain appeal as well, but in my opinion, also involves more “work” than laying down the initial rough draft.
2016	My committee helped shoulder that work, thereby making the editing of this dissertation much easier, and perhaps even enjoyable.
2016	I must also thank the many archivists and librarians who helped me find sources, suggested collections I had not thought of, and made the research process of this dissertation highly enjoyable.
2016	In particular, I extend thanks to the Nashville Metro Archives staff, including its director Ken Feith, and archivist Sarah Arntz, for helping me locate and access records created by and about the Nashville Public Library.
2016	These records provided most of the material for the Nashville Public Library (NPL) case study.
2016	However, the NPL also provided a significant amount of source material for this dissertation.
2016	In particular, the NPL Special Collections Division’s vertical and subject files on Nashville schools, churches, organizations, and  iii   individuals deeply enriched the NPL case study.
2016	Furthermore, NPL Special Collections staff member Megan Adovasio-Jones suggested a master’s thesis that wonderfully documented the events leading up the NPL’s integration, particularly when and how it integrated.
2016	I also must thank staff at the Nashville-Davidson County Metropolitan government for allowing me to peruse through record book upon record book of city ordinances.
2016	I am also grateful for the assistance provided by Atlanta Public Library (APL) Special Collections staff member John Wright and director Kelly Cornwall.
2016	For days, both helped me go through Special Collections’ records and materials created by and about the APL.
2016	They also suggested other materials and institutions to consider as I researched my APL case study.
2016	Staff at the Atlanta History Center and the Robert Woodruff Library also provided their time and expertise by helping me locate various sources and collections that provided additional insight as I wrote the chapter on the APL.
2016	While researching the Birmingham Public Library (BPL) case study, Jim Baggett and the staff at the Birmingham Public Library Department of Archives and Manuscripts provided an immense amount of help.
2016	They suggested collection after collection to research, as well as made available to me their own deep knowledge about the history of the BPL.
2016	Furthermore, Jim Baggett’s impressive understanding of the history of Birmingham also enriched this dissertation.
2016	A Bart McCash Memorial Scholarship awarded by the Middle Tennessee State University (MTSU) History Department Scholarship Committee in spring 2015 made possible much of this dissertation’s research.
2016	I remain very grateful for the department’s financial support.
2016	iv   Finally, I must thank my wife.
2016	While graduate school in general, and writing a dissertation in particular, has its rewards, it also involves sacrifice, and not just by the person in the degree program and writing the dissertation.
2016	The friends, family, and spouses of graduate students may not sit in the classes or write the papers, or labor over a dissertation, but they are there every step of the way.
2016	I cannot thank my wife enough for her patience, sacrifice, and dedication.
2016	She made the completion of this dissertation and Ph.D. possible.

2016	Acknowledgement
2016	ACKNOWLEDGMENTS I have many people to thank for getting me to this point.
2016	The most important of those are my parents, Joe and Mary Luetkemeyer.
2016	Though my dad died in 2008 before I ever started working on my doctorate, he and my mom were always my biggest supporters when it came to pursuing my education.
2016	They always encouraged me to go as far as I wanted to go, and I thank them both for helping me make it all the way.
2016	I must also mention my siblings, Victor and Lucy, who are two of my biggest fans and have always expressed how proud they are of my accomplishments.
2016	I love you all!
2016	One of the most important people when it comes to completing a dissertation is your major professor, and I could not have asked for a better one.
2016	When Marcia Mardis approached me two years ago and asked me to work on a grant project with her, I remember a colleague telling me to                     best advice I received during the three years of my doctoral program.
2016	Marcia has been instrumental in helping me to finish this research, as well as to the refinement of my academic writing skills.
2016	She has also been an amazing mentor who has repeatedly placed my best interests before her own, and who I credit as the main reason that I secured an academic position before I ever even finished my dissertation.
2016	As I follow the tenure-track career path, I know that she will remain a large part of my work and that I will re                   Thank you, Marcia!
2016	Also important are those people that support you during the day-to-day minutiae of life as you work on your doctorate.
2016	They are, in fact, the most vital to your success.
2016	My boyfriend is one of those people.
2016	He has no idea how much he helped during this process.
2016	He was the calm to my storm, my safe haven when the stress of it all seemed to be more than I could handle.
2016	He was the one that truly saw me at my worst and loved me anyway.
2016	Thank you, Elliott McCaskill.
2016	I love you.
2016	Other people who supported me day-to-day were my fellow doc students.
2016	I appreciate them all, but most especially these: Laura Clark and Amelia Anderson, who started the program with me and were always there to commiserate; Abby Phillips, who became my go-to for dissertation questions and my                    discovered earlier in the process; and Nate Ramos, my roommate and sounding board.
2016	Last, but not least, I want to thank my other committee members: Dr. Juliann Woods for her enthusiasm for my work; Dr. Don Latham for his calm demeanor, sage advice, and faith in my ability; and Dr. Gary Burnett for the creation of information worlds theory and his unique perspective that made my project that much better.
2016	A very special thank you also to Dr. Nancy Everhart who, along with Dr. Marcia Mardis, created the Technology Leadership Survey and graciously allowed me to use it for this research.
2016	By the grace of God, I am done!

2016	I am grateful to the School of Communication and Information, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences of Rutgers University, and the Professional Staff Congress of the City University of New York for their financial assistance in underwriting my fieldwork costs in Jamaica and New York City.
2016	I am also extremely grateful to all my respondents in Jamaica and New York City, who allowed me access to their homes and their lives.
2016	All of them were extremely patient, generous of spirit, and willing to share their private thoughts with me, a complete stranger to most of them.
2016	There were several individuals in Jamaica whose ongoing support contributed greatly to meeting my fieldwork goals.
2016	These include Janet Kaya Weaver for transportation and Marjorie Williamson for transcription services.
2016	I want to especially  iv   thank Kathleen Watson in Brooklyn, New York, as well as Erma Clarke, Karen Thompson, and Don Thompson in Kingston, Jamaica for their emotional reassurance, confidence in my abilities, their friendship, tasty meals, a cozy bed, and social gatherings to give me much needed respites.
2016	I thank all my family members in New York City whose constant encouragement kept me focused.
2016	My son, Noel Titus in particular, was my ongoing cheerleader, as at the start of my PhD program, we were both in college together.
2016	I am also grateful to my deceased mother Olive Hortensea Aarons Stewart who was very supportive of my decision to do this research, and dedicated herself fully to my education from kindergarten to the present.
2016	v
2016	ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS  I would like to thank Dr. Robert Riter, Dr. Miriam Sweeney, and Dr. Diane Bragg for serving on my thesis committee and guiding me through this process.
2016	Without them I would still be staring a blank page wondering what was I was going to write.
2016	I would also like to thank all the professors and instructors who’ve pushed me throughout my academic career.
2016	Without those pushes I would have never had made it this far.
2016	I am entirely thankful for each and every one of those pushes.
2016	I would also like to thank my Mom.
2016	She gave me my love of learn and through her life and her heroic battle with cancer she taught me to never give up, fight hard, and always do your best.
2016	Finally, I would like to thank my fiancée Laura.
2016	She put up with me as I researched, wrote, and randomly told her random facts about restaurant collecting institutions.
2016	Without her listening ability and her love this project would have never been finished.

2016	ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Obtaining a doctorate is not a singular journey of one individual, but rather a collaborative journey of many.
2016	To Debbie Kachel, Cindy Keller, and Debbie Emberger, I am grateful for your comforting support, encouragement, and guidance, but most importantly your friendship.
2016	To my Temple “cohort” of Sharon Fransen and Mary Lou Herron, we have weathered and grown through our coursework and time together.

2016	To Dr. Mary Kay Biagini from the University of Pittsburgh, I thank you for your guidance and contributions to my work.
2016	Finally, I would especially like to thank my advisor, Dr. Michael W. Smith for his patience, guidance, and understanding.
2016	I read somewhere that Michael wanted to be that little voice that whispers suggestions and ideas in his students’ ear to make them reconsider and think about a particular perspective.
2016	He accomplished that goal very well.
2016	Michael’s constructive suggestions and encouragement pushed me beyond what I thought I was capable of doing.
2016	I also want to thank Michael for helping me to see “the forest for the trees” when it came to my writing.
2016	A simple thank you does not convey my deep gratitude and appreciation for all that he has done.
2016	I truly sit at the feet of the giants.

2017	Differences in management might depend on the intended use, the focus of metadata, and other institutional variances.
2017	This may lead to valuable collections being abandoned or left deteriorating (see Figure 2) at the end of a project.

2017	State geological surveys face a variety of preservation challenges in relation to their geological data collections.
2017	Many facilities would like to have full maintenance for their samples, however these organizations do not have the proper resources to do so or lack a standard procedure for curation (NRC, 2002); resources include staffing, funding, and space.
2017	The NRC (2002) provides a number of examples of potential loss of geological data collections.
2017	For example, in 2002, cores collected by the Tennessee Valley Authority and the Department of Energy were being stored outside, in the elements.
2017	The cores are from such important locations as the Clinch River Breeder Reactor site and the Oak Ridge Reservation.

2017	The province report provides an illuminating example of record creators situated within a large organization using a recordkeeping tool to help document a wicked problem.
2017	The monthly province report serves as the core object of study for this dissertation.
2017	Studying the report as a phenomenon in its own right, rather than using it as a mere vehicle to get at its content, provides a case study that yields insights into recordkeeping behavior, within the context of organizations attempting to address wicked problems.
2017	Conversely, this study also affords the opportunity to explore how wicked problems can be understood as recordkeeping challenges.
2017	Problem Statement As will be discussed in Chapter Two, the literature on wicked problems is primarily populated with works that can be roughly grouped into three categories: those that focus on the nature of wicked problems; those describing how various challenges, such as climate change, are wicked problems; and literature exploring methods to help organizations and communities address wicked problems.
2017	Few of these works discuss the role recordkeeping plays in grappling with wicked problems.
2017	14 Over the past decade, some scholarship has emerged from the library and information science field to discuss wicked problems within a LIS context.
2017	However, most of this literature only characterizes a particular challenge within LIS, such as research data management, as a wicked problem.

2017	With this dissertation, I ask, “How does the public library spark and sustain the voluntary learning of adolescents with the affordances of space, resources, and people?” I answer this through an ethnographic case study of public library services for teens in a community with a high percentage of immigrant residents.

2017	This dissertation aims to mitigate the dearth of communication-based scholarship on employment loss and encourage theoretical and empirical examinations of this topic by making two contributions.
2017	First, this research challenges the cognitive and rational assumptions of extant job loss models (e.g., Latack et al., 1995; Leana & Feldman, 1988) and offers an alternative perspective on job loss and coping that foregrounds the constitutive role of communication (e.g., Fairhurst & Putnam, 2004; Putnam & Nicotera, 2009) as a guiding ontology.
2017	Drawing on the theories of sensemaking (Weick, 1979, 1995), structuration (Giddens, 1984, 1991), and dialectics (Bakhtin, 1981; Baxter & Montgomery, 1996), the proposed framework reconceptualizes job loss as a situated, emergent, and contested experience, and casts displaced workers as agents whose quest to cope with their circumstances is both constrained and enabled.
2017	This dissertation also makes an empirical contribution by using its proposed framework to examine the practice of blogging as a means of coping with job loss.
2017	Through in-depth analysis of interview transcripts and blog posts spanning six months, and using a grounded theory approach (Charmaz, 2006), this research probes the blogging practices of four laid-off professionals and identifies the coping tensions they grappled with, as well as the discursive strategies they used to navigate them.
2017	Findings reveal that blogging was problematized both as a routine and a practice by the dialectic interplay of two overarching coping imperatives, namely the need to reverse job loss (Resolution) and the need to weather it in the meantime (Endurance).
2017	On one hand, bloggers grappled with the appropriateness of committing to a blog instead of dedicating themselves fully to their job search (Productivity vs.
2017	Distraction).
2017	In addition, they tried to harness the coping benefits of blogging while making sure that looking back on their experiences did not ultimately hold them back as well (Looking Back vs. Moving Forward).
2017	To manage these tensions, participants deployed a variety of transcendence and integration strategies (Seo et al., 2004).
2017	Specifically, productivity displays and legitimization logics enabled them to transcend tensional dynamics by reframing blogging, in turn, as a public record of productive time use and as a legitimate part of a productive routine.
2017	On the other hand, humor, disclosure logics, and distancing tactics proved useful for mitigating the constraining effects of blogging on participants’ ability to move on emotionally and professionally from their job loss, while still allowing them to reap its coping benefits.
2017	CHAPTER 1.
2017	INTRODUCTION Between 2007 and 2009, the United States grappled with the worst and longest financial crisis since the Great Depression of 1929.
2017	According to the Wall Street Journal, this recession cost Americans 7.3 million jobs and 21% of their net worth, and left the national economy mired in elevated joblessness (Murray, 2010).
2017	As in previous downturns, the extensive damage to the job sector received ample coverage from formal news organizations and media outlets in the customary form of market updates, layoff announcements, commentary from economic experts, and field reports documenting the impact of job loss on affected individuals.
2017	However, traditional forms of mass-mediated journalism were not the only window into Americans' unemployment struggles in that crisis.
2017	Supplementing them with intimate, interactive, and often real-time coverage of the recession's fallout were the countless tales of post-layoff life generated by affected individuals (and others) on blogs, discussion forums, social network sites, and other social media outlets (e.g., Dizik, 2009; Dutta & Fraser, 2009; Herbst & Holahan, 2008; Klaassen, 2009; LaGesse, 2009; MacMillan, 2008; Rose, 2009).
2017	Indeed, social media emerged as popular outlets and coping tools for people affected by the recession, a space to vent, come to terms with job loss, evaluate career options, network one's way to new jobs or useful job leads, reach out to others in similar circumstances, and exchange emotional and professional support (e.g., Alboher, 2008; Dizik, 2009; Herbst & Holahan, 2008; LaGesse, 2009; MacMillan, 2008; Rose, 2009).
2017	Although noteworthy, this phenomenon is hardly new or surprising.
2017	A look at the well-established literature on online social support shows that blogs, message forums, and other social media applications are common destinations for people trying to cope

2017	1.1.1  Traditional Model of Private Insurance: Employer-Sponsored Insurance Employer-sponsored insurance (ESI) is the most common type of health insurance in the United  States, with over 150 million Americans procuring their health insurance through their employers every year (Kaiser Family Foundation, 2015).
2017	ESI has been the foundation of the United States (U.S.) health care system since the 1930s and 1940s.
2017	In the U.S., health insurance began during the Great Depression, where hospitals would offer prepayment plans to employment-based groups to ensure that patients would pay their bills.
2017	The health insurance system continued to develop as a product of wage freezes during World War II (Glied & Borzi, 2004, p. 404).
2017	The federal government imposed price and wage controls on employers, and, in response, savvy companies began offering health insurance to combat the wage freeze and entice employees.

2017	Engagement with Library Resources  A Dissertation Presented to The Faculty of the School of Education Texas Wesleyan University  in Partial Fulfillment of the Requirements for the Degree Doctor of Education in Educational Leadership by Sharon K. Manson  December 2017  Approved:  Twyla Miranda, Ph.D. Dissertation Chair  Jearl K. Helvey, Ed.D.
2017	Committee Member  Kay Colley, Ph.D. Committee Member  Celia Scott, Ph.D. Director, Doctoral Program  Carlos Martinez, Ph.D. Dean, School of Education    ABSTRACT Sharon K. Manson The purpose of the current study was to determine whether adding gamification to a doctoral level class would improve 1) students’ self-reported feelings of motivation, competency, and engagement, and 2) knowledge of the library resources available to complete research.
2017	Twenty-one students agreed to participate and completed the pretest survey.
2017	Eleven students completed the online gamified learning experience and responded to a posttest survey.
2017	Five of the student who did not complete the gamified quest answered an additional survey to understand their reasons for not completing the game.
2017	In addition to surveys, qualitative data was collected and analyzed.
2017	The students who participated in the online quest found improvement in almost all areas surveyed.
2017	Additionally, qualitative data and in-game remarks from the participants supported those findings.
2017	The results of this study demonstrated that adding a gamified learning experience could improve motivation, increase engagement with library resources, and reduce library anxiety.
2017	Chapter I Introduction to the Study The purpose of the current study was to determine whether adding gamification to a doctoral level class will improve 1) students’ self-reported feelings of motivation, competency, and engagement; and 2) knowledge of the library resources available to complete research.
2017	Gamification is using game thinking and game mechanics to solve problems, engage users, and change people’s behaviors (Zichermann & Linder, 2013).
2017	Burke (2014) explains “gamification breaks larger goals into smaller practical challenges, encouraging players as they progress through levels, and engages them emotionally to achieve their very best” (p. 24).
2017	Game mechanics are the rules (points, levels, challenges), and rewards (trophies, badges, leaderboards) that make up gameplay—the aspects that make it challenging, fun, satisfying, or whatever other emotion the game’s designers hope to evoke (status, reward, achievement, self-expression, altruism, competition).
2017	These emotions, in turn, are the result of desires and motivations called game dynamics (Bunchball, Inc., 2010).
2017	Background Gamification has been steadily making headway into educational settings.
2017	As millennials enter the workforce, they are followed by even more technically savvy younger students in schools.
2017	Never having known a world that was not wired, much has been written, researched, and discussed about GenY, digital natives, or Millennials as the first generation of unconsciously competent users of digital technology, growing and
2017	ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS It has been said that it “takes a village to raise a child” and it also takes a village to support a doctoral dissertation.
2017	First, my deepest appreciation goes out to all my participants in Philadelphia and everyone I worked with through the Freedom Rings Partnership.
2017	When I felt deeply overwhelmed and that I couldn’t possibly write another sentence, I thought of the Philadelphia coalition and their commitment to social justice and to the “telling of untold stories.” I hope that I have told such stories in a way that can inform others but – above all – inform change in local communities and national technology policies.
2017	This is not a struggle that ends with this project.
2017	I would like to thank my committee, Todd Wolfson, Philip Napoli, Jorge Schement and Michelle Rodino-Colocino for their constant support and for making me a better scholar.
2017	My adviser, Todd, brought me onto this project in only my second year as a PhD student in 2011 and taught me everything I know about ethnography and about being an engaged scholar and activist.
2017	My committee member, Phil, strengthened this project and gave me my “first academic break” when he hired me as a graduate assistant at the Donald McGannon Communication Research Center at Fordham University during my master’s study in 2007.
2017	I was fortunate to arrive in the School of Communication and Information (SC&I) PhD program during Jorge’s tenure as Dean; despite his busy schedule, he always took time to mentor students like me.
2017	When Todd and I had our first meeting about this as a potential dissertation in 2014, he asked me to go home and research the outside member who could best guide this project.
2017	I was thrilled when that scholar, Michelle, agreed to come onboard – I cannot imagine this project without her expertise.
2017	v   SC&I truly had the most caring group of PhD students one could ever ask for.
2017	My special appreciation goes to Charles File, who had a front row seat to the highs and lows of this project.
2017	My fellow Media Studies cohort member, Debra Glassco, became a fast friend and a sounding board at every step in the process.
2017	Katie McCollough was generous with her dissertation feedback and spent many hours coaching me through the final few months.
2017	When Camille Reyes began her tenure as a PhD student in 2011, I served as her “peer mentor” –yet, by the time I was finished, the roles were quite reversed.
2017	I also want to thank some other program friends: Alexa Bolanos, Maggie Boyraz, Frank Bridges, Jonathan Bullinger, Robyn Caplan, Danielle Catona, Josie Cudjoe, Ian Dunham, Jack Harris, Muge Haseki, Marie Haverfield, Katie Kang, Emily Knox, Sean Leavey, Vyshali Manivannan, Steph Mikitish, Rannie Teodoro, Andrew Salvati, Jacob Sanchez, Fredrika Thelandersson and Aaron Trammell.
2017	I would also like to acknowledge Steven Miller, Annie Gilbert and Khadijah White for making me a better instructor throughout these years.
2017	I am appreciative that the Eagleton Institute of Politics gave me the opportunity to serve as a Martin Fellow in 2014 – 2015.
2017	Many family members and friends helped me during the PhD process and beyond.
2017	My best friends (Elizabeth Ayerle and Pia Varma) and cousins (Chessa Budai and Amanda Crowell) endured my PhD neurosis day and night, with constant love and wit.
2017	At critical times, my sister and brother-in-law, Emily Crowell and Jiby Philip, encouraged me to shed my writing uniform of sweatpants and t-shirts and go out into the world for a little while.
2017	In the last year of writing this dissertation, I lost my dear grandmother – “Gigi” –I will miss her.
2017	Finally, my deepest gratitude to my mother and father, Nancy and Jim Crowell, for their love and constant support.

2017	Factors in Engagement of Reading for Pleasure  Over forty years of research has been done to identify the factor of low engagement of reluctant readers to read for pleasure on all levels of education.
2017	Krashen (1993, 1995, 2006), Jenkins (2009), Whitmire (2010), Allyn (2011), and Hahn (2012) discovered high engagement and more effective learning when students read for pleasure than rote classroom comprehension assignments or listening to a lecture.
2017	Krashen (1993, 1995, 2006, 2013) concluded that a major factor to helping reluctant readers is reading for pleasure.
2017	In addition, Miller (2009); Harrison (2012); Whittingham, Huffman, Christensen and Mcallister (2013); Stoller, Anderson, Grabe and Komiyama (2013); Meredith (2014); and Pittman and Honchell (2014) found that reading for pleasure is essential for reading comprehension and future student success in school.
2017	Krashen (1993, 2006); Hahn (2012); van Arnham and Spiller (2014); and Kang (2015) expressed in their studies that school libraries are hugely important to engaging students in reading for pleasure in our nation’s schools.
2017	All four studies concluded that the school library’s main purpose is to promote literature to the school community and could be a solution to students reading for pleasure.
2017	In this study, the focus was on a high school library, which is the center for reading in a high school.

2017	I appreciate all the times we have spent together, not only working on my dissertation but also visiting and having laughs with our husbands.
2017	I also want to acknowledge my NIU colleagues, especially those in the first doctoral seminar.
2017	You have all inspired me to push through this process.
2017	See you all on Facebook!
2017	My family members have been an inspiration from the littlest learners to the newest college students and grads.
2017	Thank you for your love and support.
2017	I also want to thank my principal, Mr. Martin, and the faculty research team.
2017	Our students are fortunate to have such dedicated professionals.
2017	I am amazed by the commitment you have shown in teaching our students.
2017	And to my husband, Bill, there are not enough “thank yous” for the kind of support you have given me over the years during my time at NIU.
2017	To another Bill, Dr. BT Meyer, thanks for your inspiration as the supportive rock that you are for our family.
2017	ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS  This dissertation would not have happened if I had been left to my own devices.
2017	I was ready (and willing!)
2017	to give up, many times, but I had some wonderful people in my corner.
2017	First, my dissertation chair, Dr. Pi-Sui Hsu, was supportive and compassionate through all of my bouts of writer’s block and doubt and never gave up on me.
2017	Her thoughtful and thorough attention made this turn out better than I could have expected on my own.
2017	My committee members, Dr. Olha Ketsman and Dr. Rebecca Hunt, each brought expertise that was invaluable.
2017	Dr. Hunt’s background in school librarianship helped to ensure that my narrative stayed on track, and knowing that a seasoned school librarian was checking my work helped me to feel confident in my product.
2017	Dr. Ketsman’s mixed-methods course was the kick-start I needed to push forward when I felt like throwing in the towel, and her knowledge and presentation of mixed-methods research made the process make sense to me.
2017	I am grateful for all of the ETRA professors, especially Drs.
2017	Hsu, Mayall, Butler, and Hung.
2017	You do not know what you do not know, and I cannot imagine learning from a more qualified group of instructors.
2017	I would also like to thank my classmates in ETRA.
2017	I thoroughly enjoyed our thoughtful discourse, comradery, and shared experience.
2017	I hope to see you again.
2017	This would not have been possible without the support of my family.
2017	My mother-in-law, Dr. Michele Weber, was an amazing brainstorming partner, and her ability to cut through to the essential questions and elements was a huge help to me.
2017	My parents and my father-in-law cheered me on.
2017	My husband, Bill, and my sons, Liam and Ethan, understood that I had class or that I could not be interrupted or that I had to go meet someone to interview them or that I was cranky and anxious...they were supportive of me every step of the way.
2017	ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS  I would like to offer my deepest gratitude to everyone who has helped me throughout this process.
2017	I sincerely apologize to any I have overlooked; it is my hope that you will forgive me if I have neglected to acknowledge your assistance.
2017	I truly am grateful to all who have contributed to my work.
2017	First, I would like to thank all of the subject specialist librarians at the University of Missouri, Columbia.
2017	I would like to specifically thank Dr. Paula Roper for your suggestions and recommendations.
2017	Cindy Cotner and Marie Concannon, I would like to thank for so much including asking and listening, without the glazing over of your eyes, to my topic.
2017	Sandy Schiefer, the items you forwarded on to me were of great use.
2017	Rhonda Whithaus, my former supervisor and dear friend, you have helped and supported me in ways too numerous to put here.
2017	The Reference Librarians and student workers at Oral Roberts University Library have made this work possible.
2017	I would like to thank all of the student workers who helped gather information for my work, especially Danielle Glover, Rebecca Bennett, Scott Simonton, Angie Reyes Matamoros, Dadiva Maldonado, Sarinporn “Yam” Chaivisit, Supavida “Yim” Chaivisit, Hwasong Ryu, Ayumu Ano, Samantha “Sam” Bruner, Cassandra “Cassie” Van Dam, Sara Bennett, Jasmine Forrest, Kaitlyn Gustin, Kayla Campbell, and Sarah Hanson.
2017	Without your assistance and diligence helping me to gather background documents, making sure my files were OCR, and even scanning in a few items, this work would still be in progress.
2017	ii   Dr. William Jernigan, Dean of the University Library, Oral Roberts University, Jane Malcolm, Assistant Director for Public Services, Oral Roberts University Library, and Annette Villines, Head of Reference Services, Oral Roberts University Library, a ‘thank you’ is not adequate to express my debt of gratitude for all you have done to support my work, and allowing the student workers to assist me, and for your love, friendship, support, encouragement, and prayers.
2017	A special ‘thank you’ to Mary Ann Walker and Dana Higeons, Oral Roberts University Library Technical Services for your prayers, friendship, and support during this process.
2017	Dr. John Budd, thank you so much for your support and encouragement and all the times you had to tell me to just stop gathering information.
2017	To you, and the rest of my committee, Dr. Jenny Bossaller, Dr. Denise Adkins, Dr. Lisa Dorner, and former committee member, Dr. Peggy Placier, thank you for your patience throughout this process.
2017	While it is customary to acknowledge family and spouses in the Dedication, without the efforts of my dear husband, David, in scanning numbers of articles and even entire books, and proofreading my drafts, not to mention all of the lunches, dinners, taking over the move from Columbia, Missouri to Oklahoma in the middle of this process, and handling literally everything else, I would still be at work.
2017	You have been my everything throughout this process, and I cannot thank you enough.

2017	The Theory of Reasoned Action  17   1 Chapter 1: Background and Problem Statement Introduction and Rationale A typical day in the school library begins early, often before the morning bell rings for classes.
2017	Students will come into the library to access computers for a variety of purposes.
2017	They may be researching something for a class or writing a paper.
2017	They might complete online math practice or take quizzes for reading accountability.
2017	While the school librarian gets carts of laptops and iPads ready for the day, teachers come in asking for curriculum materials.
2017	After making sure lessons on research and technology are ready for the day, the librarian might take time to troubleshoot technology issues that arise.
2017	Throughout all of this activity, students browse the library looking for materials to read on their own time.
2017	Adolescents are frequent users of all types of libraries (Craver, 1987; Lin, Yueh, Wu, & Fu, 2014) and as evidenced by the typically daily activities enumerated above, adolescent use of the school library ranges in nature.
2017	As school libraries took shape in the 20th century, they were viewed primarily as a resource for materials.
2017	Expensive editions, hard to find books, and volumes of dictionaries lined the shelves with equipment and technology taking up a smaller portion of the collection.
2017	As we ushered in the 21st century, collaboration, technology, and information literacy became much larger components of library programming.
2017	Librarians have also evolved from being in charge of the warehouse of materials to collaborating, instructing, and supporting the community.
2017	Yet even as school libraries have evolved over the past 100 years, reading remains a primary tenet of their mission and major part of what takes place in them.
2017	Smith (2006) found in her Wisconsin study that public elementary school libraries averaged almost 730 check outs per week, with schools that   2 have a full-time librarian reaching 880 check outs.
2017	While school libraries have become a hub for technology and information literacy abandoning the notion of reading in school libraries would be unfair.
2017	The American Association of School Librarians (AASL) emphasizes the importance of reading in several of their position statements (AASL, 2010a, 2010b, 2016a, 2016b, 2016c).
2017	Reading is described as being an essential 21st century skill and creating lifelong readers is a primary goal of school libraries.
2017	School librarians are responsible for providing leadership in literacy instruction, planning reading promotions, obtaining materials that match curriculum and standards, providing current digital resources, instructing students on how to read and evaluate information in mixed formats, and giving access to a wide variety of high quality, high interest materials that meet the needs of the student body.
2017	Though there is much direction on how a school librarian is essential to literacy instruction and the cross-curricular role that reading plays in education, AASL does not ignore the personal aspect of reading and its role in creating lifelong readers.
2017	The organization states, “It is imperative that school librarians work with teachers and parents to find ways to instill in students the joy of reading while helping them build the reading habit” (AASL, 2010c, para.
2017	2).
2017	In order to do this, the librarian must engage students, find materials of high personal interest, value and promote independent reading, and encourage reading for enjoyment.
2017	Clearly, the role of books and reading is alive and well and should be examined more closely.
2017	In fact, AASL also emphasizes that providing a vast selection of materials in school libraries is critical due to the nature of the diverse population of children we serve.

2017	Libraries are repositories of knowledge, literal warehouses of books both fiction and fact, from comic books to business directories.
2017	Librarians sitting behind reference desks strive to answer literally any question one can throw at them, from where is the restroom to what is the gross national product of Mongolia.
2017	Librarian expertise at searching and retrieving information for patrons is a product of their education; the vast majority of librarians in the United States earn their Master's in Library and Information Science (MLIS) from American Library Association (ALA)-accredited library schools.
2017	Librarianship itself encompasses a wide array of roles, from reference librarians to catalogers to archivists.
2017	In addition, librarianship occurs in a variety of settings, from the public library to the academic library to the corporate or special library.
2017	In the schema of modern labor, librarians are firmly in the tier of white-collar workers (Nauratil 1989).
2017	However, librarianship is an example of a profession that has been increasingly challenged in recent years by technological innovation, unstable budgets, and administrative downsizing.
2017	Library technology such the online public access catalog (OPAC) and the Integrated Library System (ILS) has introduced significant automation into library operations.
2017	In addition, the rapid development of the Internet, culminating in the now ubiquitous tools known as search engines, has reduced the role of the library as the predominant center of information in the community.

2017	This manuscript argues all knowledge organization systems—biological and otherwise—are constructs of cultural and historical circumstances, manufactured artifacts of certain spatiotemporal positions.
2017	My goal is to show how other disciplines can inform the literature, theories, and work within Information Studies to rethink our problems anew.
2017	As I see it, the question is no longer whether our classification systems can attain true representational capacities, it is more about how we are going to acknowledge their constructedness and harness their contingencies for the most situated social benefit.
2017	ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS  I want to thank all the people who supported me during and leading up to my doctoral study.

2017	Acknowledgements
2017	ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS  This project is the culmination of a long journey.
2017	Certainly the last nine years, through my doctoral coursework, examinations, research, and writing.
2017	But my inspiration came in many forms at many moments.
2017	Some from my childhood, when my engineer father instilled an interest in history, historical places, and mechanical things.
2017	I recall our visit to the Quincy Mine in Hancock during my teenage years and our mutual amazement upon finding our family name forged into joists of the giant steam hoisting engine constructed by the Nordberg Manufacturing Company of Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
2017	My route back to the Keweenaw wasn’t through industrial history, but as an archivist charged with selecting and preserving historical records.
2017	And it was while working at the Michigan Tech Archives that I found its collection of blueprints from the Nordberg Manufacturing Company.
2017	Over time, I learned that these materials were once part of a larger collection of records created and held by the company, that they had been surveyed by curators from Smithsonian Institution, and that the collection had been broken into pieces and transferred to repositories around the country.
2017	This was the original kernel for this project: Which are the most important archival repositories collecting records of business, industry, and technology?
2017	How and why did they begin collecting manuscripts?
2017	What influenced what they collected?
2017	What did they turn down (and what happened to that stuff)?
2017	Is there enough historical archival material preserved to answer the myriad of questions we have (and will have) about business, industry, and technology?
2017	It may not seem much of a surprise to find an archivist writing about archives.
2017	But there is actually very little research into the history of archival repositories.
2017	The study of archival history is challenging, ironically, because archivists are not great record-keepers about our own history.
2017	We devote most of our available resources to caring for the records of other people, organizations, and corporations, treating our own administrative records as little more than necessary bureaucratic reports.
2017	We tend to be suspicious about doctoral researchers asking questions about how and why we made the choices we did, especially if those choices resulted in the destruction of historical records (even if those Page iv   records were not within our repository’s specific collecting scope).
2017	Access may understandably be denied to donor case files and accession records, which often include purchase prices and other confidential materials.
2017	Suspicions may be heightened when the doctoral researcher behind the study is also an archivist at a ‘competing’ institution.
2017	Add to this the author’s stated intention to compare and contrast practice at multiple institutions – and to share the analysis publicly – and one can imagine an increased level of hesitation.
2017	Sadly, in some cases, these anxieties resulted in denied access to internal records and disinterest in personal interviews about historical practice.
2017	Not only was this frustrating to this doctoral archivist researcher, but it ultimately limits how much our profession can learn from its own history and how much it can improve its future activity.
2017	Thankfully, this study was supported by many archivists, librarians, and museum curators with an interest in transparency and a welcoming attitude to the project.
2017	A full list of the individuals who participated in personal interviews is included in the bibliography, but I am particularly grateful to John Fleckner, Robert Vogel, John White, and Barney Finn at Smithsonian, Chris Baer and Lynn Catanese at Hagley, and Judith Endelman, Terry Hoover, Cynthia Read Miller, Brian Wilson, and Linda Skolarus at The Henry Ford.
2017	During this research, I was welcomed by a group of archival scholars who meet annually at the Archives Education and Research Institute.
2017	These meetings provided a platform to test my content in front of a patient and forgiving audience, and receive valuable feedback from the leading experts in the field.
2017	More importantly, though, was finding a cohort of fellow dissertators sharing similar journeys in other programs.
2017	This GED group (“Get ‘er Done”) urged me on, shared my successes, and lamented my struggles.
2017	My sincere thanks to Jenny Stevenson (PhD) in Milwaukee, Eliot Wilczek (PhD) in Boston, Katie Pierce in Austin, Jonathan Dorey in Montreal, Snowden Becker and Dalena Hunter in Los Angeles, Anastasia Weigle in Maine, and Chris Colwell down under in Sydney.
2017	We were never together in one space for any length of time, but the internet is a magic thing.
2017	I also want to acknowledge my extended Michigan Tech, Copper Country, and work families.
2017	During my 18 years in Houghton, lines were blurred between faculty, Page v   fellow students, professional colleagues, and personal friends.
2017	I’m certainly thankful to my committee: Susan Martin, Steve Walton, Bob Johnson, and chair Terry Reynolds.
2017	While impossible to name everyone, I would be remiss if I failed to also mention Patrick Martin, Bruce Seely, Larry Lankton, Carol MacLennan, Kim Hoagland, Lee Presley, Scott See, Sean Gohman, and Paul White.
2017	I have been lucky to work with a myriad of cool people who held down the fort while I was distracted with thoughts of industrial archives.
2017	These include Christine Holland and Beth Russell at the Michigan Tech Archives, Robbe DiPietro and Karen Rhodes at the Michigan Humanities Council, members of the “Breakfast Club” (Virginia Thomas, Sandra Martin, and Paul Gallagher) and Sandy Yee at Wayne State, and Brandon Carter at the Reuther Library.
2017	Jo Urion and Sue Scanlan continue as true blue friends.
2017	My one regret is that I didn’t finish in time for Tom Scanlan to buy me a congratulatory beer; his supportive smile and questions about “the big D” kept me focused on getting this dissertation done.
2017	Finally, there is my real family.
2017	My mother and father, Darlene and Gary Nordberg, raised me right and have supported me at every step.
2017	I developed my love of history through AAA TripTiks and guidebooks, family subscriptions to National Geographic and Arizona Highways, and countless trips to historic sites as far flung as Colonial Williamsburg, the walled city of Luxembourg, Cape Canaveral, Michigan’s Copper Country, and the historic Bushmills Distillery in Northern Ireland (I particularly liked that one).
2017	Their generosity and love continues to inspire me.
2017	This work could not have been possible, however, without the steadfast support of two individuals who understood what I was trying to do, constantly reminded me why this work was important, and why I was the person to do it.
2017	Dr. Terry Reynolds has served as my dissertation advisor, faculty member, mentor, editor, academic colleague, and friend.
2017	I still feel a bit of an imposter about this whole thing, but it was Terry’s reassuring and supportive tone – as well as the occasional “gentle inquiry” about my intentions to continue – which kept me on track to finish.
2017	It is typical of Terry’s character that he continued this support – with increasing commitments of his personal time and finances – even into retirement.
2017	Page vi   Jane Nordberg, my best friend and also my wife, has been with me every step of the way.
2017	She provided encouragement when I was on the struggle bus, applied an external editorial eye to my awkward prose (and the occasional Scooby Doo sticker if a draft chapter passed muster), and donated large portions of our ‘together time’ to the research, writing, and conference needs of a multi-year dissertation project.
2017	It is impossible to adequately acknowledge, appease, atone, and apologize for all of the doctoral hoopla these recent years.
2017	At the end of the day, however, it will always be just the two of us Sunday driving, not arriving, with your limitless undying love shining around me like a million suns.

2017	Acknowledgements
2017	ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS I wish to acknowledge the many people who made the completion of my dissertation possible.
2017	I would first like to thank my dissertation committee for their time and commitment to my work.
2017	In serving as my committee chair, Dr. Eric Oslund was a steadfast and knowledgeable guide, providing clarity and encouragement at many key steps.
2017	Dr. Amy Elleman vastly expanded my school librarian’s mindset regarding literacy, and helped me to later bring these ideas to fruition.
2017	Dr. Terri Tharp had extraordinary intuition to know just when to check in on me, whether it was to answer my qualitative research questions or offer moral support.
2017	And Dr. Charles Milligan offered me his valuable perspective as a former high school administrator; his ideas shaped the entire direction of this study.
2017	Each of you offered diverse and extremely important viewpoints, but were also all-around collegial and warm individuals to work with; I admire and appreciate you all.
2017	In addition to my committee, several other individuals at Middle Tennessee State University offered me valuable support during my dissertation.
2017	Dr. Jwa Kim gave me very helpful feedback regarding my study’s methodology.
2017	Dr. Jason Martin scored my qualitative data for reliability.
2017	Ms. Bonnie Allen, Dean of Walker Library, generously provided funding and support for my studies, including supplemental funding to support the dissertation’s study.
2017	The dean of MTSU’s College of Education, Dr. Lana Seivers, also stepped in to provide financial support for the dissertation’s study.
2017	I am grateful to each of you.
2017	ii   Completing this doctoral program was only possible due to the love and support of my family.
2017	My parents, James K. and Donna Nourse, made education a priority from an early age, and inspired me to aim high.
2017	My sister Kelly gave me much-needed pep talks throughout my studies, but also made me laugh when I needed it most.
2017	My mother’s parents, James D. and Ethel Roop, kept their home filled with books and set an example of lifelong learning.
2017	My father’s parents, James A. and Maggie Nourse, provided strong examples of determination and self-reliance which have guided me throughout my life.
2017	My in-laws, Hugh and Betty Reed, provided continual encouragement and praise.
2017	Although I am blessed with a large and supportive extended family, I would single out my uncle Dr. A. Kevin Nourse who was the first in my family to complete his Ph.D., and therefore was my good example and mentor.
2017	Getting to this point in my educational journey was absolutely predicated on the best decision I ever made in my life: namely to introduce myself to the man who would later become my husband.
2017	Meeting in 1992 as college freshmen, Matt and I later graduated and began a life together; he did not know at that time that this would involve him supporting me through numerous degrees.
2017	Matt did it all with unwavering encouragement and infinite graciousness.
2017	He, along with our children Emily and Andrew, fill me with the love and strength to want to do the best I can at whatever I attempt.
2017	iii
2017	ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS  Though this document has my name on it, it is far from an individual effort.
2017	Christine Jenkins guided me through this process with insight, perspective, and humor.
2017	She challenged me to dig deeper and think more expansively.
2017	Her enthusiasm for this project was infectious and the intellectual connections she made as well as her questions about my work provided insight and perspective that I greatly appreciated.
2017	She made my work better.
2017	I cannot thank her enough.
2017	I also want to thank my committee members: Alistair Black was generous with his time and advice from the outset; I am grateful to Dan Schiller for asking hard questions, offering good advice, and introducing me to the annual reports of the Department of Agriculture; Linda Smith never waivered with her support or her enthusiasm.
2017	I offer a special thanks to Melissa Cragin who served on my committee at the proposal stage.
2017	Thanks to the many colleagues, friends, and family who listened to me talk about this project over the years.
2017	My fellow Information in Society Fellows, Caroline Nappo and Shinjoung Yeo, helped make this a more challenging, interesting, and satisfying journey.
2017	Conversations with Naomi Bloch, Irene Catalán, Tom Dousa, Noah Lenstra, Robbie Lieberman, Jerry Shenk, and Mikki Smith always included good, hard questions and insight that provoked new ways of seeing and nourished my enthusiasm for this research project.
2017	The culture and community at the Graduate School of Library and Information Science at the University of Illinois are remarkable.
2017	In addition to my committee members, I am especially grateful I had the opportunity to work with faculty at the School and at the University Library and Archives.
2017	These people included Pauline Cochrane, Susan G. Davis, Leigh Estabrook, Don Krummel, Bill Maher, Carole Palmer, Chris Prom, Boyd Rayward, Ellen Swain, and Anke Voss.
2017	I learned right away that the IT and the support staff at GSLIS are the real heart of the operation and I have nothing but sincere thanks for each of them.
2017	This type of work cannot happen without libraries and archives and the people who work in them.
2017	I owe a debt of thanks to the many librarians and archivists who helped me locate resources, engaged in conversations about sources, and pointed me to new material.
2017	Among iv   them staff at the Library of Congress, the National Agricultural Library, and the Mann Library at Cornell University.
2017	The University Library at the University of Illinois at UrbanaChampaign has collections so deep one could drown and I owe a special thanks to the librarians and staff who kept sending me into the depths but who also helped me keep my head above water!
2017	There is no question that I have a strong bias in favor of public libraries and the work librarians, archivists, and other staff do to build collections and make them accessible.
2017	Without question, search engines pale in comparison to the skills, smarts, and humor these folks have.
2017	I would not trade them for the world!
2017	Lucy Moynihan deserves more thanks than can fit on this page.
2017	She shared my interest in and passion for this topic, served as my personal reference librarian, and never lost faith.
2017	I am grateful for her love and for her friendship.

2018	Acknowledgements
2018	ACKNOWLEDGMENTS As a full-time library director and doctoral student with a 2.5 hour commute, there are many thoughtful, encouraging, generous, and understanding people in the circle of support I relied upon to make this PhD journey even remotely possible.
2018	x Dr. Jeff Weddle, a kind, constant adviser and a most supportive committee chair, along with Drs.
2018	Miriam Sweeney, Wilson Lowrey, Holley Wilkin, Jane Baker, and Robert Riter, a committee whose guidance and wisdom directed my path; x Dr. Shuhua Zhou, Dr. William Evans, and the CIS Graduate Studies office, and Dr. Ann Prentice, Dr. James Elmborg, Beth Riggs, Dr. Ann Bourne, and the SLIS faculty and staff, who took a chance on me, championed my journey from day-one, and provided a steady stream of thoughtful advice and positive energy.
2018	x President Emeritus Judy Bonner and Vice Chancellor Jo Bonner, both of whom made indelible impressions upon my undergraduate career at UA and were kind enough to help me find my way back as a graduate student years later.
2018	x Spencer Ross, my husband and favorite person, who has always supported my goals and dreams and has kept me happy and sane for more than 2 decades.
2018	Honey, we're the big door prize.
2018	x Steven Yates, who generously opened his home to me and offered years of encouragement, advice, and lots of laughter, resulting in a friendship that feels more like family.
2018	x My library family, Robin, Brenda, Paige, Maranda, Heather, and Peyton, who have held down the fort at my library for years and made my double life of practitioner and student a possibility.
2018	x My Board of Directors, Mike Onderdonk, Carol Bumpers, Betty Dumas, Robert Montgomery, and Ashli Page, who never hesitated with their approval of my pursuit of this degree, and who are beacons for life-long learning and progress in our library and community.
2018	x Harold and Belinda Crouch, my uncle and aunt, who have walked beside me through each step of my education, from Kindergarten to PhD, and whom I thank for my career as a librarian.
2018	x My family members and many friends, who have loved and supported me, despite my many absences during gatherings and celebrations over the last 4 years.
2018	iv   x Cristin Brawner, whose generous time as moderator of my focus groups was greatly appreciated.
2018	x The Alabama Public Library Service staff and the many librarians around the state who have mentored and inspired me as we work toward shared goals for literacy and community building.
2018	x The 32 people who were willing to share their time and perspectives as participants in this study.
2018	x My hometown, the community that inspired this study, and the wonderful people who make it such a special place.
2018	Four years ago, I was called-out by a student who challenged me to aim higher and dream bigger, and who, in that moment, changed my trajectory and my future, as I immediately picked up the phone and called SLIS to inquire about the doctoral program.
2018	What a blessing.
2018	I thank God for the gift of that moment and for this opportunity to study under great minds in order to become a better information professional, a clearer communicator, and a more prepared changeagent in my community.
2018	v
2018	Acknowledgements "God is within her, she will not fail" (Psalms 46:5), this inspirational Bible verse was instilled in me by my daughter as I overcame challenges during the dissertation process.
2018	It was through words of encouragement from my daughters, Kierstin, Briannin, and Jewelein, that lifted me; laughter from my son-in-laws, Daniel and Zachary, reminding me to enjoy life; the home of my in-laws, Marilyn and Bob, that provided a place to focus; and the commitment of my parents, Sherry and Richard, setting in motion my education path as a first generation college student.
2018	To my family and friends that supported this mission, I appreciate you listening and cheering me to the finish line.
2018	To my colleagues, I am grateful for your interest in my research and investment towards educational advancement.
2018	To the members of my dissertation committee; Dr. Jodi Nichols (chair), Dr. Heather Hurst, and Dr. Lea Messman-Mandicott, I thank you for providing words of wisdom and guidance throughout this process to completion.
2018	This research is dedicated to my husband, Bobby, who was the reason I began and ended the dissertation journey.
2018	With his vision and coaching, he inspired me to persevere through years of classes, months of research, hours of writing, periods of setbacks, and an extended timeline.
2018	This accomplishment was achieved as a team because of his belief in my ability, his respect towards my career, and his understanding of priorities.
2018	Our love forever remains constant; finally, it is time to begin our next adventure together.
2018	After four years, I reflect on this experience.
2018	I plan to use my knowledge to improve myself as an educator, expanding my opportunities.
2018	Thanks to God for being with me every step of the way; "But as for you, be strong and do not give up, for your work will be rewarded" (2 Chronicles 15:7).
2018	ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Dedicated to Laura Greenstone the love of my life and my partner in everything "Trauma is both personal and communal."
2018	Laura Greenstone M.S., L.P.C., ATR-BC Laura Greenstone is my partner in everything and this dissertation is as much a product of her support, inspiration, and focus as it is of my own blood, sweat, tears, and drive.
2018	In 2012 shortly after Hurricane Sandy had ripped through coastal New Jersey, Laura and I drove to the microshelter being established at our town middle school.
2018	As a disaster response crisis counselor Laura wanted to check-in with the incident commander in person since communication systems were overwhelmed and communication to the disaster response crisis counselors across the county was spotty and limited.
2018	As Laura checked in, I charged our cell phones in the hall.
2018	A tall woman came out of the gym and asked what do I do?
2018	As we talked, I said I was a Boy Scout a long-time ago.
2018	She said well, come with me then.
2018	As I followed Wendy Baggot into the gym Laura was talking with a man who I later found out was Oceanport's Director of the Office of Emergency Management, Buzzy Baldanza.
2018	Wendy put me right to work reorganizing the intake desk and recruiting more volunteers.
2018	Five-plus years later, this dissertation was completed after starting as a set of scratch notes on scratch paper on the organizing and communication processes I saw unfolding around me as I worked with an emerging team of volunteers and professionals to address the impacts of Hurricane Sandy in our town.
2018	I had no idea what my observations and hastily written jottings may have been, or where iv   they might lead, only that I was witnessing from the ground, if not the basement, an emergent organizing process tied in some way to an institutional framework that was itself undergoing rapid change in a compressed period of time.
2018	If not for Laura and Wendy, this project would not have been formed out of those experiences and observations.
2018	Without Laura's ongoing support and inspiration this would be a very different study of community dynamics and partnerships in communities wrestling with complex environmental change.
2018	As an art therapist, Laura's work in trauma-informed counseling and psychological first-aid helped shape my perspective on long-term recovery and community resilience.
2018	Over the last several years we talked at length about the idea of resilience; what it was, whether it was psychological, social, communicative, or perhaps all three.
2018	These conversations along with related work on resilience sciences I have been in engaged with Marya Doerfel, my adviser, helped shape my perspective on the communication and organizing processes enacted after a disaster.
2018	Laura is a healer who impacted countless lives through her work with 9/11 families, in working with families impacted by domestic and sexual violence, in her work with Sandy survivors, and in the countless hours she spent training, supervising, and working tirelessly without pay to expand the role of the creative arts therapies in healthcare and the different mental health services.
2018	But far beyond that, Laura was my partner and the love of my life.
2018	Married in Scotland in August 2016, we were married outside an old castle, on ancient lands, on an isolated peninsula, in an economically distressed part of the Scottish Highlands, in an ancient ceremony in which Laura entered the Lamont and Harris Clans, the families of my heritage.
2018	But a funny thing happened, those we connected with and still remain in v   touch with there are all actively engaged in their communities and in trying to revive the social and economic life of the Cowal Peninsula, where we were married.
2018	This summer a series of environmental art therapy sessions are being offered at Historic Kilmun, a historically important church central to community and clan life in the area.
2018	Dunans', the castle lands where Laura and I were married, and their affiliated endeavors are organized as social enterprises.
2018	Even in our romantic life, we could never escape the people and places that were community focused and concerned with social impact.
2018	Laura's influence and my work on the impact of communication and organizing processes of long-term recovery naturally follows from my very early studies with Wilson Carey McWilliams.
2018	A political theorist, Carey was the one who first introduced me to Alexis de Tocqueville's work and to think through the many different sides of governance and democracy.
2018	Carey always stressed the importance of community for good democratic governance and civic life.
2018	It is those long-ago conversations with Carey that I turn to time and time again when wrestling with problems of cross-sector relationships and tensions between grassroots and institutional organizing processes.
2018	Without Carey and Laura, my intellectual growth would have been stunted.
2018	Marya Doerfel has been my adviser, friend, colleague, and collaborator.
2018	She has been a constant on this journey with me, a journey harder and darker than either of us ever imagined when we first embarked on it five-years ago.
2018	Over the last five-years, through the death of my father, two major illnesses of my mother resulting in her moving into a long-term care facility, and the sudden loss of Laura from long-standing complex medical conditions, Marya has been the steady hand on the tiller guiding me through many shoals and steering me away from the rocky shoreline.
2018	Without her steady vi   guidance, compassion, and wisdom this journey would have been much tougher and more perilous than it has been.
2018	Marya's expert guidance led me to defend and publicly present in a way and at a time that Laura could be there.
2018	What more can one ask for?
2018	And I think we both wish now, that Laura did ask the burning question she was going to ask during the Q&A portion of my public presentation, "does this mean you will be cleaning the garage now?"
2018	I first met Jorge Reina Schement and Nancy Kranich at an event at the MIT Media Lab when I thought my research would be related to civic media and digital organizing around complex environmental problems.
2018	Jorge and Nancy eventually became good friends with Laura and I.
2018	We connected over shared interests in art, policymaking, media, and life in general.
2018	We shared dinners together at different venues in different New Jersey coastal towns along the way.
2018	Jorge became a trusted confidant, a member of my dissertation committee, and a great source of insight, advice, and wisdom.
2018	Nancy and I talked often about policy and politics and she was an invaluable source of information, insight, and advice on community dynamics and public policy.
2018	But beyond that, we were able to simply enjoy each other's company away from the hurly burly of academic and professional commitments.
2018	Mark Aakhus served as a constant source of clarity and provided piercing insights along the way.
2018	Mark has a way of asking questions that help break down the most complex processes and questions into simple steps that provide impactful answers.
2018	Mark has been a valued confidant, trusted adviser, and along with Marya has journeyed with me along this winding, dark path since the start of my program.
2018	Without Marks' guidance and support this would have been a much tougher journey.
2018	I first met Amy O'Connor vii

2018	Even as the public library movement gained momentum in America in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Jim Crow era laws and policies barred Black community members from accessing many public, state-funded libraries.
2018	This is a history the modern library institution must contend with.
2018	The ways policies have created a material reality in which access to libraries was denied to large groups of citizens are still present in the very design of some library buildings and the communities in which they exist.
2018	While evolving policies, such as civil rights legislation and the Americans with Disabilities Act, have formally increased access to public libraries, various factors still conspire to restrict, even if unintentionally, certain groups from accessing the resources within.
2018	To move, however modestly, toward the ideal vision of the public library, I conduct an examination of the spatial rhetorics of libraries in Toulouse, France, and develop a set of criteria that can be used to analyze the accessibility of a wide range of library spaces.
2018	These topoi specifically address the exteriors of libraries and the ways library buildings inhabit space and interact with their communities and neighborhoods.
2018	Second, I apply these topoi to three libraries in Houghton County, in the Keweenaw Peninsula of Upper Michigan.
2018	Last, I make a two-fold recommendation to all libraries that wish to become more aware of their spatial rhetorics.
2018	First, I recommend an examination of the spatial rhetorics of the exteriors of library sites to help library workers understand and mitigate the ways library buildings are inadvertently inaccessible.
2018	Second, I suggest the employment of a geo-spatial mapping survey to center the voices and experiences of

2018	ii   ABSTRACT The purpose of this study was to examine elementary school library practices to determine if particular practices affected student learning.
2018	This study described the circulation practices, collection leveling practices, scheduling practices and collaborative practices between school librarians and classroom teachers in high performing and nonhigh performing elementary schools in Missouri school districts with an enrollment of 750-1,500.
2018	Data was collected via an online survey and analyzed using ANOVA and the constant comparative analysis method.
2018	Results of the study showed only one statistically significant difference between the high performing and non-high performing schools: High performing schools are more likely to allow students to visit the library to check out books during the school day than non-high performing schools.

2018	Acknowledgements
2018	ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This dissertation has been a labor of love that began 7 years ago when I decided that engaging in academic research and university teaching was my calling.
2018	The journey has been challenging and exhilarating for me and I am a wiser and happier man for it.
2018	I would like to thank my academic advisor, Dr. Chirag Shah, for his mentorship, encouragement, and guidance throughout my years at Rutgers.
2018	Dr. Shah has been instrumental in my development as a scholar and researcher in information science and is always a source of great ideas and conversation.
2018	My work on data gathering tools like SIMPSON and SOCRATES would not have been possible without Dr. Shah's guidance.
2018	I would like to also thank the members of my dissertation committee, Dr. Nicholas Belkin, Dr. Marya Doerfel, and Dr. Winter Mason, who were very generous with their time and advice.
2018	I feel lucky to have had, not only such prestigious academics of the highest caliber on this dissertation committee, but also ones so thoughtful and kind.
2018	I would like to expressly thank Mr. Kevin Albertson who helped immensely with the development of the SIMPSON tool and who saved my data gathering efforts more than once over long-distance phone calls between Santa Barbara and New York City.
2018	My deep gratitude also goes out to my colleagues at the School of Communication and Information (SC&I), including my wonderful colleagues in the InfoSeeking Lab: Dr. Dongho Choi, Dr. Erik Choi, Dr. Roberto Gonz�lez-Ib��ez, and Dr. Matthew Mitsui.
2018	Of the many faculty and staff at SC&I whose friendship, wisdom, and advice were immeasurable over the course of my time at Rutgers as a doctoral student and part-time lecturer, I'd like to particularly thank Dr. Keith Hampton, Dr. Mor Naaman, Dr. Mark Aakhus, Dr. Craig Scott, Dr. Laurie Lewis, Dr. Claire McInerney, Dr. Stew Mohr, Dr. iv   Sharon Stoerger, Dr. Matthew Weber, Dr. Jennifer Theiss, Dr. Marija Dalbello, Dr. Marie Radford, Dr. Anselm Spoerri, Dr. Karen Novick, Mr. Jon Oliver, Dr. Jonathan Potter, and, of course, my good friends Dr. Marie Haverfield, Dr. Amanda Carpenter, Dr. Lora Appel, and Mr. Punit Dadlani.
2018	There were certain students at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who assisted me with data collection tasks that I'd like to acknowledge here as well: Mr. Vincent Chan, Ms. Samantha Perez, Ms. Angeline Benitez, and Ms. Vanessa Chacon.
2018	I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to my former professor and mentor, the late Dr. Ronald P. Olowin, who inspired me many years ago during my undergraduate studies at Saint Mary's College to become engrossed in science and research.
2018	He continues to be the ultimate blueprint for what I consider a great teacher and wellrounded university professor to be.
2018	I never had less than super-enthusiastic support from my mother and father, Sanaa and Albert, and my sister, Nada, and for that, I love them and thank them dearly.
2018	Last, but certainly not least, I would like to express my deep gratitude, admiration, and love to my wife Dr. Jennifer Gibbs who unconditionally supported me in every way imaginable and believed in my academic adventure from the very start.
2018	She was, and continues to be, my biggest cheerleader throughout the successes and the challenges that I invariably encounter.
2018	I'd like to also thank my darling children Maxwell and Zeina for their unreserved love and general cuteness.
2018	May this work inspire them one day to achieve academic accomplishments of their own.

2018	administrators have sought to implement a model of continuous, embedded, one-on-one professional development within the context of daily ELA instructional practice (Neumerski, 2013).
2018	Theoretical Context Time constraints, competing demands, and lack of knowledge and expertise often prevent school administrators from fully engaging in the role of instructional leader (Hallinger, 2005).
2018	Distributed leadership theory acknowledges that multiple leaders are needed to assist a school administrator in fulfilling his or her instructional leadership responsibilities.
2018	These leaders must possess the necessary skill sets and dedicated time to focus upon engaging in curriculum and instructional improvements.
2018	In California, some K-12 public school administrators have identified instructional coaches and teacher librarians as leaders that meet these criteria and possess the ability to provide continuous, one-on-one professional development.
2018	As such, distributed leadership theory will serve as a framework for developing an understanding of why and how California K-12 school administrators distribute instructional leadership responsibilities to either instructional coaches or teacher librarians and how the interactions among the leaders enable them to meet CCSS ELA instructional goals (Neumerski, 2013; Spillane, 2006).
2018	Historical Context The instructional roles of instructional coaches and teacher librarians appear to be similar in nature (CDE, 2013, 2015a; Knight, 2007; Marzano & Simms, 2013).
2018	Both are expected to be experts in providing professional development.
2018	Both are also expected to establish collaborative partnerships with teachers in the planning, delivery, and assessment of instruction in order to improve student achievement.
2018	Where the roles appear to differ is in instructional content;
2018	commitment required to mentor individuals makes it difficult to implement a cognitive apprenticeship for a large number of learners.
2018	The strategy that has been associated with costing the most amount of time is the one on one relationship between the expert and the novice.
2018	If the expert is working with more than one novice at a time, the expert may have difficulty with time management, especially when juggling other responsibilities (Brown & Stefaniak, 2015, 2016; Woolley & Jarvis, 2007).
2018	One possible solution, as proposed by the author of this paper, is the use of peer coaching to decrease the work load of the instructor.
2018	While there has been extensive research on some aspects of these strategies, there is a paucity of research pertaining to specific strategies used to coach individuals.
2018	There is a proliferation of literature defining coaching, coaching models, and scenarios in which coaching should be utilized, however, there is a lack of literature on specific strategies related to how to coach an individual, let alone, how to successfully incorporate peer coaching into an online, asynchronous learning environment.

2018	The sociology of knowledge provides a claim by Castells (2010) that the information age yields organizations characteristic of the “network society” (p. 21), defined as a new kind of social structure and manner of social organization that is global in nature and constructed on networks.
2018	Digital technologies afford the opportunity for greater ease of managing complex networks on a global scale, redefining identity and social structures (Castells, 2010; Hardt & Negri, 2009).
2018	In an adaptation of these concepts for library and information studies, Pierce (1992) points to the lack of a

2018	(p. 38) BBW members took turns choosing texts to read on a rotating basis, and met roughly every two months, though generally a bit more frequently during the summer break between spring and fall school semesters.
2018	While conversation during book club meetings would largely focus on that meeting’s chosen book, participants would also inevitably discuss their experiences in the LIS program and related arenas such as paraprofessional library jobs, internships, volunteer positions, and other career advancement opportunities.
2018	As a participant in this book club since its inception, it was clear to me early on that this group functioned as a community of practice (Lave & Wenger, 1991) in which participants learned about themselves and one another
2018	within the knowledge community for further development.
2018	Each year academics and professionals alike attend associational conferences.
2018	Conferences draw researchers and innovators interested in similar ideas to present research concepts, frameworks, theories, methods, and investigations to colleagues and add to a profession, field, or discipline through discourse.
2018	This discourse, referred to as conference proceedings, provides some of the most recent explorations and phenomena and provides researchers the opportunity to develop and disseminate new knowledge, make new intellectual connections, and develop intellectual theory.
2018	These collected works serve as a written record and are usually distributed to attendees and association members as a journal.
2018	Once distributed, these writings often relay the latest developments in a profession, field, or discipline and create a knowledge domain that may be considered the research front.
2018	can gain in judgement in creating their own future.10 The eleven presidents who succeeded Roosevelt, as well as one president who preceded him, followed his lead in preservation of their presidency, resulting in the following libraries: Herbert Hoover Presidential Library and Museum; Harry S. Truman Presidential Library and Museum; Dwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library, Museum and Boyhood Home; John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum; Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum; Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum; Gerald R. Ford Museum; Jimmy Carter Library and Museum; Ronald Reagan Presidential Library; George Bush Presidential Library & Museum; William J. Clinton Presidential Center and Park; and George W Bush Presidential Center.11 Signed into law by Dwight Eisenhower, the Presidential Libraries Act of 1955 (PLA 1955) permitted presidents to build libraries from private funds and donate the building, their objects and artifacts, and their papers to the government.
2018	This deed of gift ensured that the administration and operations of each library would be managed by the federal government and funded by the federal budget.
2018	This legislation encouraged presidents to build facilities to house their historical legacy, but it did not require each president to participate.12 It was not until 1978 that any president was required to give materials to the  10  National Archives of the United States, “Presidential Library History”  The National Archives, “Presidential Libraries and Museums of the National Archives,” August 15, 2016, https://www.archives.gov/presidential-libraries 11  United States Congress, “Presidential Libraries Act of 1955,” August 15, 2016, https://www.archives.gov/presidential-libraries/laws/1955-act.html
2018	together to achieve it to foster student achievement.
2018	TLs have a direct influence on student achievement (Lance et al., 2000, 2001, 2002, 2005), in part through implementing collaboration efforts within the broader school community (Farmer, 2007).
2018	Successful collaboration occurs when TLs and fellow teachers incorporate information literacy into their teaching, promote reading for both acquisition of knowledge and personal enjoyment, and integrate technology within the classroom in ways that increase students’ depth of knowledge through their learning experiences (Farmer, 2007; Loertscher, 2014; Montiel-Overall, 2005a).
2018	The most successful school library programs in terms of direct impacts on student achievement are those in which TLs collaborate with teachers as equals in the instructional process (Cooper & Bray, 2011).
2018	Roles of the Teacher Librarian In today’s school setting, the roles of TLs are changing rapidly as they work to prepare students for the rigors of education and of changing and emerging technologies.
2018	TLs and school library programs encourage collaboration with teachers to promote students’ academic success.
2018	Thus, the AASL (2007) described information literacy and technology skills as crucial for effective functioning in today’s knowledge-based society.
2018	Indeed, all educators must integrate the teaching of information literacy and technology skills into the regular curriculum (Kuhlthau, 2004; Scott & O’Sullivan, 2005).
2018	The emergence of new pedagogical methods with respect to information literacy has affected the ways in which teachers and TLs impart these skills to students to keep pace with the emergence of new tools (Chu, Tse, & Chow, 2011).
2018	SUPPORT ROLES FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE LIBRARIANS  2  (Allen & Seaman, 2016), conducted by the Babson Survey Research Group under the sponsorship of publishing giant Pearson, reports that only 5.3% of courses use an openly licensed (CC or public domain) textbook of any variety.
2018	The authors observe that this percentage closely tracks the similarly small percentage of faculty who report that they are “very aware” of OER (Allen & Seaman, 2016, p. 29).
2018	Since the publishing of the first edition of the landmark Diffusion of Innovations in 1962, the work of Everett Rogers (2010) has been central in understanding the lifecycle of innovations and mapping categories of adopters, from “innovators” to “laggards,” across a bell curve.
2018	In the expansive literature on diffusion, a phenomenon known as the “chasm” (Moore, 2014) plays a significant role.
2018	Simply stated, without crossing the roughly 16% adoption point that represents the innovators (2.5%) and early adopters (13.5%) in a system and separates those groups from the mainstream “early majority” population, innovations rarely take hold to the extent that they have a significant impact on society.
2018	After 15-plus years in the marketplace of ideas, OER still falls below this tipping point.
2018	Librarians have been at the forefront of support for OER, operating in a range of advocacy and curatorial roles.
2018	However, librarians cannot drive OER adoption across the chasm by themselves—adoption takes place at the level of the individual or groups of faculty who make decisions regarding the adoption of course materials, be they traditional publisher materials or openly licensed materials.
2018	In this study the researcher will review the growing literature on the role libraries and librarians play in supporting open education and OER and the studies of the challenges that faculty face when contemplating OER adoption.
2018	Then, by means of a survey of faculty who have already had exposure to OER in various degrees through participation in a well-funded, statewide community college OER adoption initiative, the research seeks to better
2018	a sanctuary of last resort in the pursuit of knowledge and information.
2018	A national library is not only regarded as a source of national pride but also as a symbol of nationhood, representing the collective memory of the nation.
2018	(p. 1-2) National libraries serve not only traditional users, but also “virtual users (both domestic and foreign)” (Sroka, 2002, p. 67).
2018	They should make resources available for both the people of the country and users from all around the world (Khan & Shehzad,
2018	knowledge base (Foasberg, 2015).
2018	Another critique of this decontextualized, skill-based information literacy instruction (Elmborg, 2006; Foasberg, 2015; Swanson, 2004; 2005) originate from the standpoint of rhetoric and composition, both of which consider context, conversation, and active participation in literacy of all kinds.
2018	When a student engages in research, she does not simply extract and record information, as the second standard suggests, but rather wrestles with the content, draws connection with what she already knows, and generates more questions (Foasberg, 2015).
2018	In response to these critiques of the standards, the latest conceptualization of information literacy came in the form of ACRL Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education (ACRL, 2016).
2018	The framework includes interconnected information literacy threshold concepts (Meyer & Land, 2005) as well as the notion of metaliteracy proposed by Mackey and Jacobson (2011) and offers a renewed vision of information literacy as an overarching set of abilities that unifies such concepts as media literacy, visual literacy, digital literacy, and information literacy in which students are both consumers and creators of information and are active participants in collaborative spaces (ACRL, 2016).
2018	The notion of metaliteracy demands behavioral, affective, cognitive, and metacognitive engagement with the constantly evolving information ecosystem.
2018	The framework also includes knowledge practices which are demonstrations of ways in which learners can increase their understanding of these information literacy concepts and dispositions which describe ways in which to address the affective, attitudinal, or valuing dimensions of learning (ACRL, 2016).
2018	ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS  Ten years ago, I set out on a journey that I had no clue would bring me to this point.
2018	I thought obtaining a bachelor’s degree would be the pinnacle of my academic success.
2018	Getting in and out in four years was my goal.
2018	That all changed the day I stumbled across a flyer for the Ronald E. McNair Scholar’s program.
2018	Now, seven years after being accepted into the program, I am completing the acknowledgments section of my dissertation.
2018	This journey could not be made possible without the help and encouragement of loved ones, friends, faculty and staff.
2018	For those who have had an integral role in me getting to this point, you are appreciated, valued, and loved.
2018	To Dr. Betty Mei: If not for you, my journey through academia would not have been possible.
2018	Thank you for seeing what I could not see.
2018	Thank you for your wisdom and guidance.
2018	The McNair Scholars Program is great in part to your leadership.
2018	To Dr. Melanie Booth-Butterfield: To my first mentor, I owe you a million of thanks!
2018	Thank you for taking a chance on me 7 years ago.
2018	It has been a pleasure to know and learn from you!

2018	I have learned so much from you.
2018	I am glad to you know you not only as a colleague, but also a friend.
2018	Dr. Radford, long before you ever served on my committee you were an intricate part to my success iv   through the program.
2018	Thank you for being the mother figure I needed to gently push me in the direction I needed to go.
2018	I appreciate the time you took to teach and celebrate us students.
2018	You helped Rutgers to feel like “home” for me.
2018	Dr. Gailliard, through many rounds of revisions we have made it here with our minds still intact!
2018	Thank you for being the Chair on my committee and my advisor for everything else.
2018	You helped make this process easy (well, as easy as it could be)!
2018	Everyone should have a cheerleader like you in their corner.
2018	Your service is invaluable and will not be forgotten.
2018	To my mom: As I write this on your birthday, I’m grateful you are here to see me finish!
2018	There aren’t enough words that I could conjure up to express what and who you have been in my life.
2018	Thank you for all the encouragement, laughs, and free meals that sustained me through the past 10 years.
2018	You are a gem one could never afford to purchase.
2018	Glad you were gifted to me.
2018	To my sisters: Dawn and April, thanks!
2018	We are too quirky for mushy words.
2018	I look forward to continuing to laugh our way through life.
2018	You two are great!
2018	To my daddy: Life often throws us curve balls, and every now and again they are the type that make us question everything.
2018	I don’t have the answers as to why you are no longer here, but what I do know is that you are apart of me, as I was of you.
2018	I hear your voice when I sing.
2018	I see you in the little things I do.
2018	You will not be forgotten.
2018	If possible, you should be notified that I finished!
2018	Love you much!
2018	R.I.P.
2018	To Bunmi: Boomster!
2018	What can I say…You know, I questioned if it would have been a good idea to add you in my acknowledgments when I finished my master’s thesis (since we were just starting out), and here we are.
2018	Looks like I made the right choice!
2018	Going through this process with you by my side has been worthwhile.
2018	Thank you for all the pep  v   talks and lending a listening ear.
2018	And did I mention the jollof?!?
2018	Excited to see where we will go together next.
2018	To cohorts past and present: We are family and will always be!
2018	Whether it was help on assignments or sharing happy hour sodas (in my case) after a long semester, you all have been there.
2018	Thank you for giving of yourselves in hopes of seeing me succeed.
2018	To faculty and staff: How could we advance in our studies without you?!
2018	Thank you for the care and concern given throughout semesters.
2018	Thank you for office hours and followup emails.
2018	To anyone else that is not specifically named, charge it to my head (I just wrote a dissertation) and not my heart!
2018	I’d rather celebrate in person anyway, so look forward to phone calls, emails, and texts!
2018	With great appreciation and satisfaction, I do pen the last sentence of this section, culminating my experience in academia as a student.
2018	Through good and bad days, I have been tried and proven.
2018	I am my ancestors’ wildest dreams.

2018	The white American colonizers “had forced the government to westernize itself at great cost and in great haste, and then they chose to act as if the government did not exist” (Daws, 1968, p. 110).
2018	These white men were, not surprisingly, “Manifest Destiny men,”16 whose interest around this time was that the United States annex Hawaiʻi so that their businesses would benefit by being placed within the U.S. tariff structure (Daws, 1968, p. 147).
2018	Many of these white men were not benignly self-interested but were actively racist toward both Native Hawaiians and Asian immigrants (Daws, 1968).
2018	They craved economic prosperity for themselves above all else, and the nineteenth century in Hawaiʻi was plagued by white men gathering in exclusive groups to plot their ascension to power (and subsequent wealth).
2018	While some favored what they called “revolution” and others craved U.S. annexation, none wanted statehood for Hawaiʻi because that would turn Native Hawaiians into American citizens, and white men were “against equal rights for kanakas in a white man’s country” (Daws, 1968, p. 148).
2018	Honolulu was a bustling international trade port by mid-century, and that resulted in additional public issues, such as when a United States merchant ship delivered a passenger infected with smallpox in 1853.
2018	By January 1854, 2,485 people—mostly Native Hawaiians—had perished from the disease, and that number was likely inaccurate with the true death toll perhaps as high as 6,000 (Daws, 1968).
2018	By the 1860s, due to the single-minded businessmen taking over the islands, the missionaries “were in full retreat” (Daws, 1968, p. 163).
2018	From the mid-nineteenth century and through World War II, Hawaiʻi’s elite—mainly haole (foreigner/white person)  16  “The colonizers of Hawaiʻi brought with them both a profound sense of entitlement and a fear of engulfment” (Turnbull & Ferguson, 1997, p. 99) and “apologists for expansionism during the late nineteenth century justified U.S. imperialism as manifestly destined by divine sanction, geography, and racial superiority” (Okihiro, 1991, p. 17).

2018	California State University, Fresno (Fresno State) is accredited by WSCUC, and participates in assessment of these core competencies in both ongoing and cyclic schedules.
2018	content knowledge has contributed to a “classroom-as-container” discourse (Leander, Phillips, & Taylor, 2010, p. 329), one where the significant literacy learning (and research into literacy learning) is placed neatly within the classroom, and in particular, within the literacy block.
2018	While the library is intended to be a space for inquiry (New York City School Library System, n.d.), as standards for students increase and classrooms become more standardized, content specialists and intervention staff, such as school librarians, are also being called to take on more defined roles within their schools (Uecker, Kelly, & Napierala, 2014)—an “all hands on deck” attitude.
2018	As expectations for informational literacy instruction and the integration of technology has increased in the library, so have
2018	narratives might serve as rich, knowledge-based content and in what ways
2018	distributed there must be librarians with education, wide book knowledge and library training.
2018	If the library is to play a part in the education of the masses of people it must have on its staff, men and women who are aware of their needs and possibilities and who can cooperate with all other organizations concerned with the welfare of the people.
2018	(Bateson, 1945, p. 6) Bateson further suggested that training be set up within the national public library service in Jamaica, similar to what existed in Trinidad, “For those who cannot go abroad a local training centre should be set up or with that already being established in Trinidad” (Bateson, 1945, p. 9).
2018	Professional library education in the English speaking Caribbean has been influenced by a combination of events which helped move towards the eventual 1971 establishment of the Department of Library Studies at the University of the West Indies.
2018	Two of those factors are context and regional cooperation.
2018	For both context and region, an identity separate from the former ‘mother-country’, Britain, may have also played a role.
2018	Regarding context within the region, these nations have similar interconnected histories resting in the colonial past, population

2018	Box 1346 Ann Arbor, MI 48106 - 1346   ABSTRACT OF THE DISSERTATION Managing self-disclosure in social network sites (SNSs): A technology affordances perspective on privacy boundary management By SOE YOON CHOI Dissertation Director: Craig R. Scott Social network sites (SNSs) help satisfy the human need to build connections but fulfilling such need generates privacy costs.
2018	Drawing on a perspective of technology affordances (Gibson, 1979) and communication privacy management theory (CPM) (Petronio, 2002), the project proposed ways to conceptualize affordance of privacy of SNSs as to how SNSs enable users to manage information boundaries and to make selfdisclosures.
2018	Reflecting on the characteristics of SNSs that grant one not only information ownership but also information co-ownership, the project described patterns of how SNS users coordinate self and other-generated information boundaries and examined how this boundary coordination influences self-disclosure outcomes.
2018	The goals of categorizing information boundary management into these ways were twofold.
2018	First, the coordination of self and other-generated information boundaries reflects on users' needs for privacy and connectivity differently in a way that the coordination of other-generated information boundaries involves more comprehensive considerations of privacy, connectivity, and information ownership than the coordination of self-generated information boundaries.
2018	Second, the coordination of other-generated information boundaries, although meant to ii   protect privacy, can function to signal risks of privacy violation and eventually limit motivations for self-disclosure.
2018	In this project, to examine the link between information boundary coordination and self-disclosure outcomes accurately, actual SNS users (Facebook users) were recruited and their behavioral data related to boundary coordination and self-disclosure were retrieved using Facebook API (Application Programming Interface).
2018	Findings show that the need for privacy positively influences some patterns of self-generated information boundary coordination but negatively influences a pattern of other-generated information boundary coordination.
2018	The need for connectivity did not influence the coordination of either self or other-generated information boundaries.
2018	From this result, the role of the need for connectivity in shaping individuals' desire to engage in information boundary management is discussed.
2018	The project also found different functions of the coordination of self and other-generated information boundaries in self-disclosure patterns in SNSs.
2018	Although coordinating information boundaries is supposed to reflect individual efforts to protect privacy and to make more self-disclosures, the coordination of other-generated information boundaries decreased the depth of self-disclosure.
2018	The coordination of self-generated information boundaries did not influence the depth of self-disclosure but increased the breadth of selfdisclosure.
2018	Elaborating information boundary coordination that may reflect needs for privacy and connectivity in different fashions will provide a better understanding of affordance of information boundary management in SNSs.
2018	Additionally, the unintended impact of information boundary coordination on self-disclosure can contribute to expanding knowledge of SNSs' affordances to consider in-depth communication (beyond better known affordances such as association).

2018	48 vii   INTRODUCTION On March 1, 1976, Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA) volunteer Kieran Nugent was sentenced to the newly constructed H-Blocks of Her Majesty's Prison Maze/Long Kesh just outside of Lisburn, Northern Ireland.
2018	He was the H-Block's first prisoner sentenced during the Northern Ireland Conflict after the British government retracted Special Category Status, which previously classified those charged with "Troubles-related" offenses as political prisoners or prisoners of war (Taylor 203).1 In its place, the government installed Diplock courts, where the accused faced not a panel of jurors, but a single judge.
2018	Nugent was also the first prisoner to go "on the blanket" and protest the requirement to wear a prison uniform; such clothing meant acknowledging the legitimacy of the system that labeled him a common criminal and not a political prisoner.
2018	Instead, Nugent wrapped the blanket from his cell's bed around himself, and alongside hundreds of individuals arrested after him, launched the blanket protest.
2018	Two years of blanket protests passed.
2018	After no change in prison regime, prisoners began the "no-wash" or "dirty protest" where they refused to leave their cells to bathe or slop out, forcing them to smear excreta on their cell walls.
2018	This strategy continued for another two years until January 1980, when prisoners released a statement outlining five demands that constituted their definition of political status: the right not to wear the prison uniform or do prison work, the right of free association and outside visitations, and finally, full restoration of remission lost during the previous years of protests (O'Malley 20-23).
2018	When the British government refused to 1 I use "the Troubles" interchangeably with the "Northern Ireland Conflict," a sectarian and ethno-nationalistic conflict which started in the 1960s and technically ended with the signing of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998.

2018	Acknowledgements
2018	ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This is the second time I have pursued a doctoral degree.
2018	From 1989 to 1992, I attended The Ohio State University, completing the coursework for a Ph.D. in Communication, passing the general exam, and beginning work on a dissertation that I never finished.
2018	As a result, I appreciate the second chance the College of Lake County gave me to earn a doctorate.
2018	Through the College, a cohort of CLC employees was organized and the coursework funded.
2018	The courses were fully planned and, with the cooperation of Northern Illinois University, were taught at a convenient time and place.
2018	Many people provided encouragement along the way.
2018	Thanks to insulator collectors like Jim Frustieri and Scott Sweetland for being a cheering section.
2018	Thanks to members of the cohort for their support: Nedra Adams-Soller, Dave Agazzi, Jason Cashmore, Debbie Culver, Greg Gordon , Jeff Hines, Dunia Iordan, Mary Jacobs, Jorge Nieto, Margie Porter, Bob Remedi, Kathryn Rogalski, Jeet Saini, and Jorge Tennon.
2018	Thanks to my advisors.
2018	Dr. Gene Roth provided valuable, fast, and frequent feedback.
2018	Dr. Jorge Jeria inspired this work with a comment made in one of my first classes.
2018	Dr. Nestor Osorio helped in the area I knew least about--bibliometrics--and assured me I was on the right track.
2018	Cheryl Mangold deserves special thanks for the excellent work she did coding books.
2018	Thanks to my wife and cats.
2018	Both kept me sane and tolerated my neglect.

2019	Acknowledgements
2019	Acknowledgements I am incredibly grateful for the support I received while writing this dissertation.
2019	My research project would not have been possible without financial support from the Graduate School at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, part of the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research and Graduate Education, with funding from the Mellon Foundation; and the Robert F. and Jean E. Holtz Center for Science and Technology Studies at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
2019	Additionally, the Information School (iSchool) was critical in supporting my conference travel, which allowed me to present my work to an international community of scholars and information professionals.
2019	I could not have maintained my attendance at conferences like the Information Ethics Roundtable and the Archival Education and Research Institute (AERI) without the iSchool's unwavering support.
2019	My dissertation committee � Alan Rubel, Kristin Eschenfelder, Jonathan Senchyne, B. Venkat Mani, and Tonia Sutherland � has been an invaluable source of support and guidance throughout my doctoral career.
2019	I have deeply appreciated their thoughtful questions and sustained engagement with my work, which has made me a stronger writer, researcher, and communicator.
2019	Importantly, they have all helped me in moments of uncertainty with encouragement and advice.
2019	I am grateful for their steadfast commitment to both my personal and professional development, and I look forward to working alongside them as colleagues and friends in the future.
2019	I would also like to thank several other faculty members who have supported me as instructors or in teaching appointments, including Rebekah Willett, Greg Downey, Amy Sloper, Bronwen Masemann, Madge Klais, Deb Shapiro, and James Baughman.
2019	I am grateful for their mentorship and expertise which made me a more rounded academic and instructor.
2019	I acknowledge that my academic progress has been tied to the work of librarians and archivists at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, who tracked down obscure books, articles, and manuscripts for me as well as maintained the perfect backdrop for my writing.
2019	I am especially grateful to Allison Caffrey at the iSchool Laboratory Library and Troy Reeves at the University Archives' Oral History Program for their kind support.
2019	I am similarly grateful to all my interviewees who so generously shared their time and

2019	In order to combat this disconnect between the importance of information literacy skills and the lack of student interest to pursue critical information engagement, librarians are working to find new ways of providing relevant and effective information literacy instruction (ILI).
2019	In particular, librarians are increasingly moving into the learning management system (LMS), which offers many pedagogical benefits.
2019	For example, the LMS provides opportunities for the integration of ILI directly into the students' core learning environment (Bowen, 2012).
2019	This aligns library instruction with other course content and allows it to be curated by the course instructor and not just the librarian, increasing the relevance and relatedness of the material.
2019	Online ILI also allows for greater active and collaborative learning opportunities when combined
2019	ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS I would like to extend my sincere thanks to several important people.
2019	Ava--my child, who has been on this entire doctoral journey with me.
2019	She endured long rides in the backseat of the car while we traveled to and from my classes.
2019	She even practiced a musical instrument (saxophone) and completed her homework (grades 4-6) on these rides.
2019	When she was a little older, she helped with the doctoral process by giving me time to work on my dissertation and doing more chores around the house.
2019	I cannot imagine life without her, with or without a doctoral degree.
2019	Seanna--a childhood friend, who watched my child while I was in class.
2019	It truly takes a village to raise a child or to complete a doctoral degree.
2019	I am glad that she was/is part of mine.
2019	Some friends are more family than friend.
2019	I cannot imagine leaving my child with anyone else for the three years that it took for me to complete the required coursework.
2019	Danny--a special friend, whom I met during the actual writing portion of the dissertation.
2019	He always offered great support throughout this difficult and trying time.
2019	He encouraged me to continue to write when I was stuck, and he offered much needed organizational help when I was struggling with work, school, and personal issues.
2019	I cannot imagine reaching the doctoral "finish line" without his unique perspective and continual support.
2019	King Dave--a faculty member, who knows that this acknowledgement is about him even if he is not specifically mentioned.
2019	On the first night of the very first class, he jokingly told the entire cohort that we could call him by the appellation of "King Dave."
2019	And, it is important to note that we did.
2019	Now, at the end of the journey, I want to thank King Dave for taking on this quirky dissertation (which was not a case study and which used methodology that he had never

2019	Acknowledgements
2019	ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS There are many people without whom this project would not have been possible.
2019	Firstly, I would like to thank my committee members, Dr. Wooseob Jeong, Dr. Jeff Muldoon, and Dr. Paul Conway for their time, support, and constructive feedback.
2019	In particular, thank you to Dr. Jeong for always being supportive of my ideas, Dr. Muldoon for inspiring my interest in administrative theory, and Dr. Conway for spending countless hours meeting via Skype, always keeping me motivated, and reminding me that a dissertation is not a mystery novel.
2019	I would like to thank Dr. Mirah Dow for her guidance and support throughout my time in the doctoral program; as well as the SLIM and ESU faculty whose courses and guidance have helped me become the scholar I am today.
2019	Additionally, I would like to thank my Master's program mentor, Dr. Phil Eppard, for his encouragement and friendship over the last ten years, and for connecting me with Dr. Conway.
2019	Finally, I would like to thank my bosses over the last six years, John Sheridan and Dr. Debbie Nolan, who have been endlessly supportive of my studies and research.
2019	I would also like to express how thankful I am for the support of my friends and family.

2019	Acknowledgements From the tiny library in the town where I grew up where I read my way through summer vacations, to the college library where I learned the value of research, to the community college library I have called home for more than 23 years, libraries have always been a lifeline for me.
2019	Without them and without the librarians and staff who keep the doors open and make the connections with those who walk in that door, the world would be a less educated and less interesting place.
2019	To them, I am eternally grateful.
2019	To the Bergen Community College, NAU, Community College Leadership cohort, thank you for becoming my family as we worked through projects and presentations together, cheering each other on, calling each other out, and sharing each other's burdens.
2019	The connections we made during this program are lifelong.
2019	We made each other better and we made Bergen a better place.
2019	Dr. Karen Miller, Provost and Executive Vice President, Cuyahoga Community College and Dr. Michael Redmond, President, Bergen Community College guided me through the research and writing process, always encouraging and supporting me even when expressing concern that things may not go the way I had planned.
2019	I'm proud to call you my mentors.
2019	During our coursework, Dr. Deborah Lynn Rose Kish spoke to the Bergen NAU cohort about her research and research process.
2019	Her work, looking at vision, data use, strategic-planning and leadership at award-winning institutions planted the seed for this dissertation.
2019	While it took another couple of years to root, Dr. Kish was certainly the inspiration for what follows.
2019	I would be remiss if I didn't acknowledge the Board of Trustees and the administration at Bergen Community College who made this professional development opportunity possible.
2019	Also, my Sidney Silverman Library colleagues who suffered through nearly four years of my
2019	ACKNOWLEDGMENTS First and foremost I am deeply grateful to have been mentored and guided by my advisors, Professors Rajiv Ramnath and Eric Fosler-Lussier.
2019	Thanks to Rajiv, for giving me the opportunity to pursue my studies with a great degree of independence and autonomy.
2019	Thank you for believing in my research, for believing in me, and for supporting me in every aspect along the way.
2019	Your marvelous ability to abstract out the essence of a problem to pinpoint exactly where I needed to focus, as well as to help break down a seemingly complex problem into manageable pieces so that a solution became feasible, have been invaluable to me.
2019	Be it while developing and writing any work, especially my candidacy proposal or journal articles, but most of all my dissertation, or be it with managing collaborations related to my research such as with The Columbus Dispatch or Nationwide Childrens Hospital, your patient listening, insightful advice and guidance, and your supportive and helpful feedback have been truly valuable, and made the biggest difference.
2019	Any words to describe what your support and your insights have meant, to my entire effort and to crystallizing the work, would fall short.
2019	Most of all, thanks for being the Jupiter to my Earth orbit, deflecting off stray objects that could derail that orbit and keeping me on track.
2019	For all of this and more I will be eternally grateful to you.
2019	I have also been most fortunate to have been advised by Prof. Eric Fosler-Lussier.
2019	You are not just my favorite classroom teacher of all things AI, you somehow manage to balance this with great intuition in your advising for very vii   diverse areas of research in speech and language processing.
2019	I will take away great memories of all the intellectual as well as informal discussions about possible machine learning models and their enhancements, both from lab meetings and our one-on-ones, where I got to learn so much from you.
2019	Your insistence on the highest standards for any work has enabled me to push my own boundaries in developing and performing the kind of advanced research that even a year ago I didn't think I was capable of.
2019	While advising me in developing any research plans you ensured I critically evaluated every method and assumption, produced the highest quality of work and always pushed me to challenge my own perceived limitations as a researcher.
2019	Your keen attention to every detail pertaining to any work, right from concept and formulation to results and presentation, has instilled in me I hope the highest standard of work ethic, which I hope to carry forward into the world.
2019	For this, and every other lesson, I will be forever indebted to you.
2019	A Phd is a momentous journey of intellectual self-realization, of venturing into lands unknown, asking difficult questions, developing along the way the skills necessary for problem solving, learning courage in the face of uncertainty, course correcting, maybe finding satisfactory answers, hopefully making meaningful contributions into the body of human knowledge, and at the end, of great personal reward.
2019	This journey would not have been possible for me but for the support of the most important people in my life.
2019	To my family � my husband, daughter, and mothers both sides, for their unwavering love and support.
2019	Your smiles, laughter, and silent sacrifices have made all the difference in this journey.
2019	To Rakesh, for always being supportive of anything I wanted to do, for always being there for me through thick and thin, through the many highs and lows that Phd studies entail, being genuinely happy at any little victory and viii   always with a kind word, or dry humor, or sage advice during perceived failure, making it that much easier to deal with it � you really have been the rock and pillar of support in my life as a returning graduate student.
2019	I have been able to even undertake, and today, complete this journey, only because of your support.
2019	To my late father who instilled in me the love of science and engineering, and a thinking mindset to ask questions.
2019	Your inspiring words, your love and your ever-supportive encouragement and belief in me, has single-handedly put me where I am today.
2019	Just the memory of our many philosophical discussions and interactions and your progressive ideas about how women should strive to achieve their true potential and play a greater role, has been the fuel to my intellectual pursuits to this day, and will always be into the future.
2019	I wish you were here today to witness the culmination of this journey, and I am sure you are.
2019	I know you have been guiding me all along as I undertook and fulfilled this journey.
2019	To my mother, even though you didn't understand every aspect of my work or the reasons behind my pursuits, your willingness to provide mental and emotional support, and the wisdom and strength you provided through trying times during this journey has ensured I am where I stand today.
2019	To both my mother and my motherin-law for their unconditional love and support to my family and to my child, during the times they could be here with us, through the hectic schedules of our daily lives � anything said of what your love and support has meant to us, would not do justice.
2019	To my darling Ryka, from the day I became your mother, since you have walked outside of me, you intuitively knew all that was happening in my life as a student at every stage.
2019	Your smiles, your jokes, your laughter, your stories, even your tantrums, your pride in me and your belief that mommy is going to be a computer scientist someday, but most of all your unbridled enthusiasm for anything "life", your curiosity, and your ix
2019	Acknowledgments I would like to acknowledge my committee chairperson, Dr. Nancy Hastings, for her undying dedication and support throughout this process.
2019	Thank you for your unwavering support.
2019	Thank you to my entire committee for helping me achieve a goal that I have dreamed of for so long.
2019	ACKNOWLEDGMENTS I would like to acknowledge my advisor Dr. Marcia Mardis.
2019	When I say that I couldn't have done this without your patience, guidance, and support I truly mean that!
2019	Thank you for being there and not making me feel bad about the times I wasn't writing, encouraging me when I was, and being a calm voice of reason when I was panicking about one thing or another!
2019	You have been amazing and are appreciated more than you know.
2019	I would like to acknowledge the other members of my committee as well � Dr. Nancy Everhart, Dr. Kathy Burnett, and Dr. Juliann Cortese - thank you for your feedback and challenge � it has made me better!
2019	To Kimberly Amos-Tata � I doubt you get acknowledged enough � you guided me and the committee through the red tape, deadlines, and requirements.
2019	Your expertise brought it all together!
2019	And to my doctoral cohorts: Casey Yu Burnett, Lenese Colson, Sylvia Norton, Jisue Lee, Florence Paisley, Wonchan Choi, and Dong Joon Lee.
2019	Man, those first couple years were rough � but you all helped me get through it knowing I wasn't alone!

2019	Reading Proficiency.
2019	When looking at national testing scores, it has been noted that Connecticut reading scores have not shown improvement in recent years.
2019	Thomas & Kara (2018) reported that: Connecticut students overall showed no significant changes in performance between the 2015 and 2017 tests.
2019	This means the average student's test score was not considered proficient in reading or math in grades 4 and 8, though many surpassed the proficiency goal.
2019	The National Center for Education Statistics, which oversees the tests, defines proficiency as demonstrating competency over challenging subject matter that all students should know.
2019	This year's scores follow years of stagnant results and various state education reform efforts, such as intervening in some struggling schools and implementing Common Core State Standards in an effort to raise expectations.

2019	iv   ABSTRACT Community College Library Personnel Value Conflicts with Library Services that Target and Track Segments of Student Populations by Alicia Virtue Purpose: The purpose of this study was to identify and describe potential value conflicts and operational concerns perceived by community college library personnel who participated in the development and implementation of newly formed partnerships between academic libraries and student services to build equity-focused student success programs enacted by the California legislature through categorical funding.
2019	An additional purpose of this study was to identify and describe actions necessary for the successful implementation of these partnerships.
2019	Methodology: The target population was California community college library personnel who were directly involved in the new library-student equity partnerships.
2019	A total of 15 participants from 10 colleges were identified through purposeful sampling.
2019	Data was gathered through a semi-structured interview instrument.
2019	Findings: The findings of this study indicated value conflicts in patron privacy, equal access to materials, and the use of restricted funding for library operations that influenced partnership formation.
2019	Operational and logistical challenges encountered by the partners were identified, as were strategies taken to mitigate those challenges.
2019	The study indicated that library personnel felt the partnerships had a positive impact on student success and helped integrate libraries into institutional priorities that advance student equity.
2019	v   Conclusions: The researcher concluded that academic library personnel will be challenged to explore ways to fit deeply-ingrained library values into educational assessment activities as libraries participate in integrated student success initiatives.
2019	Library personnel who are partners in institutional initiatives require an expanded role in the decision-making process for resource allocation to ensure the successful development of specialized, categorically funded programs.
2019	Recommendations: Recommended areas of further research included exploration of ways libraries can contribute to outcomes-oriented programs while maintaining guiding principles of privacy and equal access.
2019	Research into the unintended consequences of reliance on narrowly-defined categorical funding sources should also be explored.
2019	As libraries continue to expand their role in integrated academic support, user perceptions of the academic library experience should be explored in order to continuously develop and provide essential user-centered library services.

2019	ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This dissertation, like so many, would not have happened without the support of the people in my life.
2019	I cannot name everyone who helped me throughout my doctoral experience, but so many deserve mention.
2019	I thank my sites and interviewees foremost, for their time and for their generous welcomes to their libraries.
2019	Each site I visited reminded me of why I love our profession.
2019	I also thank my pilot interviewees, who shared their experiences and generously tolerated my inexperience.
2019	One of the wonderful things about this research was how much I enjoyed the interviews and revisiting those conversations throughout the analysis.
2019	A dissertation does not happen without guidance, and my committee provided the best: Barbara Moran, my advisor and committee chair, who gave unstintingly of her time and counsel on every imaginable topic; Barbara Wildemuth, without whom I would know nothing about qualitative research or theoretical grounding; Mohammad Hossein Jarrahi, who gave me so many wonderful insights into organizational dynamics and practice theories; Scott Simkins, who taught me about the world of faculty development; and Kristine Brancolini, whose tireless efforts to support research in librarianship have sustained not only me but the whole academic librarian community.
2019	Kris � along with Marie Kennedy, Lili Luo, Greg Guest, and all of the IRDL team � are the guiding lights of on-the-job research in academic libraries.
2019	My family has been infinitely patient with me despite my neglect of them while working full time and going to school as a part-time doctoral student.
2019	My amazing wife Gwen has talked to me on my school commutes, read and deduped my findings, drunk endless tea with me while I iv   wrote, and tolerated my vagaries throughout.

2019	ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This thesis was long overdue.
2019	I started this degree program while I was a librarian at Valdosta State University.
2019	After having children, working at Fort Lewis College in Durango, Colorado, and now at Wichita State University, I am honestly surprised that I have completed this requirement.
2019	It was a major undertaking, and not only for me.
2019	There are many who have helped me who I would like to recognize.
2019	My thesis committee chair and academic advisor, Dr. James Archibald, has been instrumental in helping me complete this thesis and program.
2019	I appreciate his support all of these years, his patience, and his guidance throughout this adventure.
2019	Dr. Jamie Workman agreed to serve on my committee without having ever met me, and I appreciate her willingness to serve.
2019	She provided constructive feedback that undoubtedly improved this work.
2019	I owe many thanks to Dr. Alan Bernstein, Dean of Libraries.
2019	His support has shaped the trajectory of my own career, and his dissertation gave me direction in constructing this research project.
2019	I am so grateful for his friendship and wisdom.
2019	I am fortunate to have a large network of informal mentors.
2019	I have had excellent bosses.
2019	I have had horrible bosses and failed formal mentoring experiences as well.
2019	All of these experiences inform my research and my own practice as a leader.
2019	Although I will omit her name, I am very grateful to the mentor I was assigned through the Library Leadership and Management Association who never once contacted me or returned my calls.
2019	Her inaction inspired me to be a better mentor myself and to continue striving for success in my career.
2019	The Dean of University Libraries at Wichita State University, Kathy Downes, has given me time and encouragement to complete this degree.
2019	She released me to work on writing at times when I imagine she would have preferred I complete other administrative projects that more directly relate to the operation of our libraries.
2019	Without her encouragement, I don't think that I would have pursued the completion of my degree, as I remember sharing with her during my interview that I had "made peace" with abandoning it.
2019	My family has always believed in my intellectual ability and supported my desires.
2019	I appreciate all of the love and empathy my parents, John and Patti Harkey, and my sister, Jessica Chorney, have shown me during this stressful time.
2019	My kids have actively worked against my completion of this thesis, but I don't blame them a bit.
2019	Nigel and Damian inspire me to make them proud, and while they take up my free time in wonderful ways, they also bring me focus to be more productive in the time I do have to dedicate to my work and my research.
2019	v   Finally, Dr. Max Brenton Harkey Williams--the most supportive and understanding husband anyone could have--deserves more credit and thanks than I will ever be able to give.
2019	I appreciate beyond measure his willingness to relocate so I could pursue an administrative position in Wichita.
2019	On top of my busy work schedule, he has endured many nights and weekends of my thesis work.
2019	I am glad that this current chapter is coming to a close so that we can spend more time together watching Netflix, traveling, and hopefully brewing beer again in the future.
2019	Brent, I love you.
2019	vi   Chapter I INTRODUCTION Currently, mentoring is a topic of vigorous discussion in higher education.
2019	This is particularly true among academic librarians.
2019	Leaders within the profession, such as Maggie Farrell (2019), actively publish in this area.
2019	Conference proceedings of the Association of College and Research Libraries also reflect pervasive interest in researching and discussing this subject.
2019	Because the concept of mentoring is ill-defined (Dawson, 2014), few answers have come out of these discussions�rather, more questions are raised.
2019	Dawson (2014) finds that "definitional differences of mentoring have been the subject of three decades of mentoring research" (p. 137).
2019	Far from resolving the issue, research in this area actually added to the problem by increasing the number of definitions significantly (Dawson, 2014).
2019	This study contributes to the conversation around mentoring in academic libraries by describing current practices regarding formal and informal mentoring.
2019	Additionally, the potential relationship between mentoring experiences and both career satisfaction and advancement into academic library leadership is considered.
2019	The focus of the project is academic librarians because of their unique situation within libraries and academia.
2019	Their jobs are similar to public or special librarians', and similar to other faculty who teach in the subject areas, but different enough to merit specific investigation.
2019	A librarian who moves from public to academic libraries would be likely to find themselves in need of mentoring�at the very least, in order to become 1   acclimated to academic culture, organization, governance, and any promotion and tenure expectations their position entails.
2019	Although helpful to have a faculty mentor from outside the library to help with general expectations of academic institutions, only another academic librarian truly understands the role that librarians play balancing traditional library service to the academic community and developing expertise and research interests of one's own.
2019	Participants in this survey-based study were currently employed academic librarians in the United States.
2019	An emphasis on disseminating the survey to those in administrative positions ensured that part of the population had advanced into this realm of academic librarianship, which was necessary for a diversity of experience around mentoring's impacts.
2019	Three research questions were as follows: 1.
2019	Have significantly more academic library leaders benefited from a mentoring relationship early in their careers than academic librarians in nonadministrative roles?
2019	2.
2019	Do those who have had the benefit of a mentoring relationship feel significantly more overall satisfaction with their career trajectory?
2019	3.
2019	What kinds of mentoring have academic librarians and leaders experienced and at which career stages?
2019	This research will help academic librarians choose which types of mentoring, if any, they want to pursue.
2019	It will help administrators and those advanced in their careers steer early-career librarians towards mentoring experiences that will be beneficial for them.
2019	It also makes a case for appreciating the role of informal mentoring of academic 2   librarians.
2019	Insufficient research has been conducted surrounding informal mentoring; this study builds upon that research.
2019	In the next chapter, a review of the literature will contextualize this research project by centering it within the existing body of knowledge.
2019	Following the literature review, research methods will be described in detail.
2019	Results will be presented and analyzed, including recommendations for further study.

2019	ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This dissertation could not have been completed without the assistance of many supportive people.
2019	My greatest appreciation and sincere gratitude go to my dissertation advisor, Dr. George Zhou, for his constant guidance and inspiration; he not only was my mentor during the research process but also was and remains an invaluable and trusted advisor for everything at the academic level.
2019	Dr. Zhou's profound knowledge and rigorous scholarship has provided me with a model upon which to base my future studies and work.
2019	I also would like to acknowledge and thank all of the hard-working members of my dissertation committee--Dr. Glenn Rideout, Dr. Bruce Tucker, Dr. Paul Berger, and Dr. Yijun Gao who indicated to me that my research is important for academic libraries.
2019	Their insightful comments, encouragement, and thorough questions motivated me to think about my research from various perspectives.
2019	Their contributions to my research have been invaluable.
2019	A special note of appreciation goes to Karen Pillon, Jennie Fallis, Dr. Jelena Magliaro, and Dr. Cathy Maskell; as my first dissertation readers, they gave me helpful feedback throughout this process.
2019	I also want to thank all of my library colleagues-- Xue Lou, Dr. Rong Lou, and Sharon Munro--who supported my online survey, the focus group process, and data analysis.
2019	I also want to thank all my support staff--Johanne Dean, Gillian Howard, Jason Horn, Franco Magliaro, and Allan Laporte--who provided a list of electronic-resource access issues, editorial suggestions, and technical assistance.
2019	Their dedication encouraged me to reach my research goal.
2019	vii    I also extend my appreciation to the Faculty of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences (FAHSS) and its secretaries for graduate studies, especially to the FAHSS Associate Dean Dr. Eleanor Maticka-Tyndale who encouraged graduate students to participate in the study.
2019	Their input improved the online survey response rate.
2019	Finally, I would like to thank all the staff members in the Leddy Library and other individuals who offered me help during my research.

2019	ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS: Writing this thesis has been a valuable and rewarding endeavor on so many significant levels.
2019	Through this experience, I have reached new depths in academic learning that I am grateful to have discovered.
2019	Since the beginning steps, from the construction of this thesis, to my efforts in conducting research, data collection, and readings about the intriguing details of new developments within the library scene, I have received tremendous assistance from many remarkable people who exceeded my expectations by providing critical institutional and emotional support.
2019	I deeply owe thanks to all who made important contributions in this journey to produce my thesis.
2019	First on this list of people, I owe my deepest gratitude to is my committee chair; this thesis would not have been possible unless, Professor Nazif M. Shahrani, had believed in me from the beginning.
2019	As a professor in Anthropology, Dr. Shahrani demanded academic excellence as well as due diligence in coursework and research assignments while maintaining a balanced relationship with regard to his guardianship role for his students which has been my great experience during this endeavor.
2019	After kindly accepting the request to become my advisor, he consistently responded to me with great enthusiasm and that always lifted my spirit.
2019	Because of his competent teaching style, I was allowed to experience intellectual freedom and the ability to express myself with preciseness of thoughts as I conceived them.
2019	Dr. Shahrani read my work carefully many times, questioning and identifying gaps, he led me to find a better frame for the flow of my narration for my thesis.
2019	I have learned so much in the two classes that I took from Dr. Shahrani; `Peoples & Cultures of Central Asia', and `Comparative Study of Middle East & Central Asia', classes expanded my understanding in studying cultures and led to my approach of the cultural themes with a more global perspective from many divergent angles.
2019	He has always provided his candid support as a mentor for which I cannot thank him enough.
2019	iv   I would also like to express my appreciation to Professor Kaya ahin, as a member of my committee.
2019	His kindness and generosity were second-to-none and he consistently demonstrated great knowledge and depth of subject matter.
2019	As an historian of Ottoman Empire, Prof. ahin always answered my questions with great accuracy and identified specific resources that supported my study.
2019	His valuable input led to inquiries that ensured me that my thesis would produce better overall coverage of the thesis' main viewpoints.
2019	From the first time I met Dr. ahin, he made my work and research efforts more enriching and easier for me to grasp.
2019	I appreciate him for his scholarly work ethic and commitment towards excellence.
2019	I am grateful to Professor Cemil Aydin, who also generously served on my thesis committee from whom I learned so much about global history within the framework of politics of historical memory.
2019	His mentorship in reading diverse works of literature were an immensely important experience for me.
2019	I benefitted so much from his resourcefulness, whenever I needed his advice.
2019	He encouraged me greatly.
2019	He was an inspiration for me to continue my degree and work with the context of history.
2019	It is also a pleasure to thank the Central Eurasian Studies Department staff for all efforts in clearing the way for me to complete this task and solving many technical issues that arose along the way.
2019	I am profoundly honored to recognize all the librarians that I have met while conducting research both in USA and in Turkey.

2019	We were allowed to choose from a list of topics: ghosts, Ouija boards, unicorns, magic, fortune-telling, crop circles, the Bermuda Triangle, witchcraft, horoscopes, s�ances, and UFOs.
2019	While this was meant to be a fun project, our teacher didn't explain what the word pseudo meant.
2019	The goal of the project was to demonstrate why these topics were either false or, at best, controversial, but the class thought we were to prove how they were real.
2019	I hurried home with a pretty serious attitude about this assignment.
2019	I was going to research and write about crop circles because I had heard they could prove the validity of alien invasions.
2019	Everything I found online confirmed my beliefs.
2019	It wasn't until I finished the paper and was practicing my presentation in front of my parents that I found out what I had written wasn't true or from trustworthy sites.
2019	My father was so concerned for his daughter's newfound devout belief in alien crop circles that he spent the night online with me looking up accurate sources.
2019	The next day during presentations, my teacher was shocked to discover that I was the only one with accurate information and sources on my subject; everyone else had gone to similar conspiracy theory websites that I had first visited.
2019	The assignment was scratched, and we moved on with eighth grade science without another mention of the failed project.
2019	While the failure of this project may have been due to the fact that our teacher never defined the word pseudoscience, it also may have been that he didn't tell us what online sources we should have been using.
2019	ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This dissertation was made possible by the enduring love of support of my family.
2019	My husband, Daniel Sink, never wavered in his belief in me nor in his willingness to give me the time and space necessary for undertaking this degree.
2019	I am truly grateful for his partnership, his patience, and his love.
2019	My children, John and Francesca, who have had to share their mother with this project over the past eight years, deserve my gratitude as well for their unconditional love and for inspiring the very heart of this work.
2019	My sister, Gina Parenti, has always been so generous and willing to help; I cannot imagine being able to continue this work without her strength and encouragement.
2019	My father, Frank Parenti, encouraged me to pursue my goals while teaching me how to develop a pragmatic approach to enable the achievement, and for his tireless genealogical work that inspired my own passions.
2019	Although she is no longer physically with me, I must also acknowledge my mother, Bernice Parenti, for all the many years of unconditional love, abiding patience, wisdom, and understanding.
2019	These acknowledgements must also include my wonderful in-laws, Patricia and Darrell Grace, who have always opened their home to me, giving me the time and space to work during the summer.
2019	Without "Camp Possum Hollow," I am certain this dissertation would not have been realized.
2019	I also extend my deepest gratitude to the participants who made this work possible.
2019	Leo Areia's enthusiasm and openness helped me grow as a researcher while contributing powerfully to the archive.
2019	I am grateful to Shannan Davis for not only agreeing to participate, but for bringing together her mother Zita Soares, her aunt M. Eugenia Machado, and her first cousin Sandra Rezendes to meet with me, literally around a table, and make me feel like a part of her family.
2019	The discussion that day cemented my vision for the archive and will help future researchers truly see the heart of the Azorean woman.
2019	Lorraine Beaumont and Tiffany Beaumont   vi Worthen spent a beautiful day with me in a sunny garden in Newport, sharing photos and stories, and made significant and supportive contributions to the archive.
2019	Christine Furtado's knowledge and passion for the Azorean culture made was a tremendous gift, and I am honored to be entrusted with her contributions.
2019	Isabel Andrade's generously offered time and support have also been meaningful for me as a researcher and for the archive itself.
2019	Lastly, I want to acknowledge the love and support of my beautiful great-aunt Elsie Sousa Cabral Correia, my grandmother's sister, and the last remaining link we have to our Sousa family ancestry.
2019	The gift of her recorded interviews will continue to enrich the lives of the four surviving children of the three Sousa sisters, Mary, Almerinda, and Elsie, their fourteen grandchildren, their twenty-three greatgrandchildren, and their two great-great grandchildren, with many more to come in the future.
2019	I would like to thank my cousin Kerry Martin and her husband Bobby for opening their home to me, our lovely 5 Manchester street, the home my grandfather built and mother grew up in, which was the perfect place from which I could work to build this archive.
2019	This work would also not be possible without the guidance and encouragement from my chair, Dr. Daniel Richards.
2019	His initial belief in the validity of the project, and his openness to hearing my ideas, gave me the confidence to pursue the archive.
2019	His thoughtful questions and constructive feedback led me down new and otherwise unconsidered directions for the work that enriched my own understanding and the scholarly positioning of the dissertation as a whole.
2019	I am grateful for the patience and respect he generously offered and every point through this process.
2019	I would also like to thank my committee members, Dr. Louise Wetherbee Phelps, Dr. Julia Romberger, and Dr. Nathan Johnson for their participation and thoughtful insights that have shown me the strengths of my work while inviting me to explore additional concepts and scholars to the benefit of the work.
2019	I would especially like to thank Dr. Phelps for her generosity   vii as a mentor, her compassion and support for me as an emerging scholar have encouraged me to continue in the field and to grow in my confidence.
2019	Writing, of course, often benefits from dialog and collaboration as well as from participating in a community of practice.
2019	I am fortunate that I belong to two such communities, one at Old Dominion University and one at Florida Atlantic University.
2019	The 2015 cohort of Dissertation Seminar students, especially Megan McKittrick, Jessica Saxon, and Sarah McGinley, and the ODU Diss Bootcamp group have been instrumental in keeping me grounded, motivated, inspired, and accountable.
2019	I am so fortunate to be part of this amazing group of writers and to be in an academically supportive environment with the utmost collegiality.
2019	The crew in the University Center for Excellence in Writing at FAU is also an amazing support system with consultants who have graciously endured the many years of my work, lending an ear and a thoughtful comment.
2019	I especially wish to thank Dr. Kathryn Wolfe for her instrumental role in helping me organize the theoretical framework for this project.
2019	Thank you to other members of my support community, Dorothy Zbornak, Blanche Devereaux, Rose Nyland, and Sophia Petrillo.
2019	Thank you for being a friend.
2019	I extend my gratitude to the entire Azorean-American community for welcoming me and instilling in me the value of hard work and personal sacrifice, and to the Luso-American Education Foundation for their generous support of the project.
2019	1 INTRODUCTION Around Her Table is a digital exhibition of artifacts from Azorean-American families living in Bristol, Rhode Island.
2019	The archive and supporting scholarship that comprise this dissertation are located online at www.aroundhertable.org.
2019	The content of the site is also preserved permanently online through the Internet Archive, located at the stable url: https://web.archive.org/web/20191115202845/http://www.aroundhertable.org/.
2019	The primary purpose for this archival project is to generate digital records of the Azorean-American community, especially those that reflect the experiences of women and domestic culture, preserve the records in an archive, and present them to a broader audience to expand representation and access to cultural identity markers.
2019	However, this project is also serving as a born-digital dissertation in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in English at Old Dominion University.
2019	As a dissertation, this archive is a digital rhetoric and cultural studies project that aims to map the decision-making processes and influences that shape archival design and delivery, and to render transparent the archivist as a locatable agent within the archive.
2019	The chapters included in this section of the archive position the dissertation within current scholarship in related fields while also providing data regarding the methods used to construct the archive and curate the digital exhibition.
2019	For archivists and historiographers, these chapters offer insight into significant procedural, ethical, and theoretical factors that need to be considered in the development of participatory cultural archives, while presenting the justifications and rationales for the design decisions for critical analysis and discussion.
2019	For researchers interested in Azorean-American culture, these chapters provide transparency into the archive's composition and the appraisal decisions that have shaped the available artifacts and how they are purposefully framed.
2019	2 As an interdisciplinary project, this dissertation occupies the intersection of several fields, including archival studies, rhetoric, and interface design.
2019	As a boundary object, the archive is studied across the disciplines and is examined through both practical and theoretical lenses.
2019	Within the scholarship from each field, there is recognition that the archive functions as a site of power in addition to serving as a site of preservation.
2019	This is a power that can be harnessed to enact social justice by increasing visibility for marginalized groups and creating a more equitable representation in the archival record, but it is also possible for oppressive social structures to be reinscribed in the archive as a reflection of dominant cultural and institutional values and norms.
2019	As archivists, rhetoricians, and interface designers increasingly engage in the development of new archival records and exhibits, it is important to understand the traditions and emerging contributions that each field's theories and practices offer as they relate to the archive--its construction, reception, and use.
2019	Examining the scholarship from each field reveals important insights into the archive although they come from different perspectives, and overlaying these transdisciplinary discussions can lead to useful implications for archival work, specifically in linking archival design processes to users' meaning-making activities.
2019	The purpose of this chapter is to review the relevant scholarship from these disciplines to illustrate the ways in which they overlap, while also making an argument for how synthesizing concepts between them is mutually beneficial, enriching each field's approach to the archive and enhancing the connections between archival theory and practice for those within these disciplines.
2019	In identifying the reciprocal gifts that can be shared between archival studies, rhetoric, and interface design, this chapter is also identifying the positionality of this project within each field and articulating the broader scholarly purposes of this project.
2020	ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Thanks to friends and colleagues from Longwood University, The University of Texas at San Antonio, and NC State University for providing support and inspiration for this project over the past five years.
2020	December 2020 ii   OPEN ACCESS ARTICLE PROCESSING CHARGE AS EPISTEMIC INJUSTICE IN THE GLOBAL SOUTH Emily Cox, M.A.
2020	The University of Texas at San Antonio, 2020 Supervising Professor: Abraham Graber, Ph.D.
2020	This project investigates the open access article processing charge (APC) in the Global South as a new variety of epistemic injustice.
2020	Current accounts of open access do not adequately describe the ethical and epistemic consequences of restrictive barriers within scholarly publishing, such as APCs.
2020	Miranda Fricker's phenomenon of epistemic injustice is used to frame the APC in the Global South as both testimonial and hermeneutical injustice.
2020	After proposing the APC as a new variety of epistemic injustice, I discuss the associated harms with each type of injustice, and why we should be concerned about these harms.
2020	To potentially remedy these injustices, I suggest recommendations for the virtue of testimonial justice and hermeneutical justice.

2020	ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS  iii
2020	ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Cris is very grateful for the love and support of her family.
2020	She would also like to acknowledge the encouragement and support of the University of Washington Information School community and the wonderful support of her team in particular.
2020	Sheila would like to acknowledge her family in support of her educational goals, especially her husband and sister.
2020	Further, she would like to thank the Seattle University faculty who have contributed to her intellectual growth during the program.
2020	The authors would also like to acknowledge this proposal is being written in an unprecedented time.
2020	The world is grappling with a pandemic requiring the closure of schools, libraries, businesses, colleges, and universities.
2020	These closures created the need for almost all residents to stay indoors and access information online.
2020	These conditions make this study more poignant given the relationship between access to online information like healthcare, K-12 schooling, and government policy and information, requiring in-home access to digital technology.
2020	It is further acknowledged that simultaneously during the pandemic, the country is addressing hundreds of years of systemic racism where cities across the nation are erupting in protests, demonstrations, and occupations.
2020	Both of these national conversations have made this study all the more relevant to marginalized and systemically oppressed communities where digital equity is a must.
2020	The authors therefore acknowledge the importance this research has on the ability of all residents to access information digitally so they may be full, contributing members of society--one goal of social justice.
2020	Additionally, the authors acknowledge and honor that this work was completed on the land of the Coast Salish peoples, colonized land which touches the shared waters of all tribes and bands within the Duwamish, Suquamish, Tulalip and Muckleshoot nations.
2020	Libraries and Digital Information  4  DEDICATION For Cris, this dissertation is dedicated to the three strong women who are her role models in life: to her mother for pushing her to reach for success, to her wife for supporting her in achieving her goals, and to her daughter for all that Gen Z will accomplish in creating equity in all its forms.
2020	For Sheila, this dissertation is dedicated to her family.
2020	Her husband and sister who have been her support and inspiration throughout this process.
2020	They have made her a better person and educator.
2020	Additionally, this dissertation is dedicated to the members of the Cohort 41 LDG3 group, whose love and support kept us going.
2020	Libraries and Digital Information  5
2020	ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This dissertation is intertwined with the "Astrolabe" project, so first I must acknowledge the inspiration of the ideal we hoped to crystallize: a unique environment for data curation and analysis that would promote sharing and reuse of valuable information that could lead to new scientific discoveries.
2020	Although we did not yet fulfill all of the objectives envisioned for the project, the process of holding meetings and workshops and writing funding proposals and articles has provided a tremendous learning opportunity for me, with so many memorable experiences and friendships gathered along the way.
2020	I am fortunate to have joined the UArizona iSchool at just the right moment to become a part of this effort, and I extend my deep appreciation to the institutional supporters of the project (and me) over the years: the National Science Foundation (award #1642446; PI Bryan Heidorn, Co-PI Julie Steffen), the University of Arizona, and the American Astronomical Society.
2020	I am also grateful for the financial support of the University of Arizona School of Information, the Social & Behavioral Sciences Research Institute, the Graduate and Professional Student Council, and the NSF-funded Institute for Empowering Long Tail Research.

2020	ACKNOWLEDGMENTS I have researched and written this dissertation during one of the most trying and rewarding periods of my life, and the successful completion of this project has only been made possible through the enduring support of many, many people.
2020	I first owe a huge debt of gratitude to my committee, all of whom offered guidance, insightful feedback, and much needed encouragement.
2020	In the moments after successfully defending my dissertation proposal, I informed my committee that my wife and I were expecting our first child.
2020	My wife's pregnancy and the first year of our daughter's life would coincide with the inception, maturation, and completion of my dissertation research.
2020	Along with congratulatory wishes from my committee, I received the reassuring information that four of my five committee members had successfully completed their own dissertations while expecting and welcoming children into the world.
2020	In addition to their scholarly insights that have informed my research and writing, my committee members have also shared in the joys (and tribulations) of new parenthood.
2020	They have all provided sound models for balancing demanding academic undertakings with a rich family life, and I will carry those lessons with me as I begin my career following graduation.
2020	My advisor, Cal Lee, deserves special thanks for his support and feedback: he has been instrumental in guiding me from my initial research idea through to a (pretty long) dissertation.
2020	Any readers of this document will appreciate the careful feedback that Cal provided on everything from grammar and sentence structure through to the intellectual core of my arguments.
2020	My wife, Rachel Finkelstein, deserves undying credit for being an incredible mother and a supportive partner.
2020	Even while returning to her job as a high school teacher, Rachel afforded vi   me time to type away at my desk along with daily encouragement.
2020	She placed my emotional wellbeing and my professional success among her top priorities, and I will be forever grateful for that.
2020	Through all this, we have grown closer than ever, laid a strong foundation for our family, and together, we have raised an inquisitive, gregarious, and thoroughly silly daughter, Annot Finkelstein.
2020	Although it has been at times extraordinarily difficult to look after a newborn while writing a dissertation, I am routinely revivified by the energy exuded by this little girl.
2020	She is a fount of inspiration as I continue my work in this area.
2020	Both of our parents have been along with us on this journey, too.
2020	They have made countless trips to visit us (and have provided free child care), making it possible for us to focus on our work as well as to continue nurturing our relationship with each other.
2020	Long before I started working on this dissertation, my parents, Keith and Rachel Post, have encouraged my creativity and curiosity, two indispensable strengths for any scholar.
2020	I hope to raise my daughter just as my parents raised me.
2020	Rachel's parents, Marvin Finkelstein and Karen Olson, have been outstanding cheerleaders for both of us, and they've tracked the progress of this dissertation with great enthusiasm--and not just because they want their grandchild's dad to have a job.
2020	Rachel's sister, Michele, and my brother and sister, Andrew and Aubrey, have likewise joined the cheering section, showering us with regular encouragement as we raise our daughter and make progress in our careers.
2020	Beyond our immediate families, both Rachel and I have been so fortunate to find a community of fellow scholars, artists, and friends in North Carolina.
2020	Among them, Patrick Golden and his partner, Rosa Kneller, have been constant companions.
2020	I have shared in many successes and setbacks with Patrick, who has always been just as ready to share a beer or some moments of respite at a favorite fishing spot on these occasions.
2020	My dear, lifelong friend Kolin vii   Smith has always been ready to talk baseball when I've needed a break and offer words of encouragement when I've needed a boost.
2020	I was also supremely fortunate to receive a five-year fellowship from the Royster Society that not only funded my doctoral education, including two full years of non-service funding, but also fostered an interdisciplinary community of faculty and graduate students that truly enriched my time at the University of North Carolina.
2020	Of course, this research would not have been possible without the inspiring community of artists that I have worked with for the last several years now.
2020	Cameron Buckley and Daniel Smith, the curators of Paper-Thin, welcomed my interest in their project and provided me with everything I needed or wanted to know, including generous introductions to all of the artists who have contributed work to the platform.
2020	I am extremely grateful to all of the artists who, in turn, contributed to my research.
2020	All the artists discussed in the dissertation are carrying out stellar projects that warrant attention beyond the present document.
2020	I hope to honor them by continuing to share this research on their amazing work in publications and presentations, as well as with my future students.
2020	Moreover, I see the present research project as only the start of my involvement with this remarkable community of artists.
2020	There are many more friends, family, and mentors that I would like to thank, but I worry about adding too many more pages to the dissertation.
2020	In lieu of rattling off an endless string of names, I'll close by saying that if we spoke at any time between 2016 and 2020, you have a part in this accomplishment.

2020	ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Dissertations are a team effort, and I want to take this opportunity to thank the members of my team who have helped me in ways both small and large throughout this stage in my life.
2020	This study grew from conversations in hallways, pep talks, constructive feedback, cups of coffee, peer edits, grammar debates, technical advice, and shared books.
2020	First and foremost, I owe so much to my parents, Joe and Carole Anderson, for their emotional and financial support from day zero.
2020	You have been proud supporters of my education and that has been foundational to my desire to push myself academically.
2020	Thank you, also, to my mother-in-law, Peggy Gold, for always being a great listener over queso dip.
2020	I want to thank my committee for their time and feedback across the many stages of this process.
2020	Thank you to Cheryl Bolick for your guidance navigating this dissertation process and for helping me put all of the pieces into place.

2020	I am forever thankful for the support of my committee and for their insights about this project.
2020	Thank you, also, to those who have helped me in the earlier stages of my PhD by serving on committees, reading my work, and pushing my thinking forward, especially vi   Claudia Cervantes-Soon, Julie Justice, Sandra Hughes-Hassell, Michael Dominguez, and Carol Pope.
2020	And thank you to Rune Simeonsson, Bradley Bethel, Franz Peterander and Brian Rybarczyk for helping me grow in ways I never expected as a graduate student.
2020	I want to offer special thanks to Leigh Hall for her guidance and advice in the early stages of this project.
2020	Thank you for the detailed feedback and for pushing me in my methodology to make my big, ethnographic dream into a reality.
2020	As a graduate student, I would be remiss not to mention the support of my peers in coursework, conference presentations, celebrations, comprehensive exams, proposals, writing days, defenses, and more.
2020	Thank you (in no particular order) to Katie Caprino, Helen Avis, Jeanne Dyches, Summer Pennell, Margaret Robbins, Sarah Bausell, Cristin Montalbano, Lauren Zucker, Lauren Bangert, Ashley Boyd, Dana Copeland, Aubrey Comperatore, Alex Reyes, and Soojin Lee for your support in academics.
2020	And thank you to Layla Aldousany, Jennie Crate, Meredith and Shai Cullop, Erica Harreveld, Emily King, Kunal Thakrar, Mark Gradoni, Jody Alexander, and CC Holm for your emotional support over the years.
2020	Most of all, I have to express my deepest gratitude to my husband, Austin Gold.
2020	He came into my life in the middle of this whole thing and probably didn't realize what he'd gotten himself into, but he handled it like a champ.
2020	Thank you for bringing dinner to my desk, for handling the household chores while I wrote at coffee shops, for listening to me "process" ideas, for celebrating my successes and for holding me when I cried.
2020	I probably could have done this on my own, but it would have been a much more isolating process.
2020	Above all, thank you for reminding me that there is a life outside of a PhD and for keeping me grounded when I needed it most.

2020	responded to the survey, interest in service enhancement through use of QR codes is low, with  only 16 libraries currently using QR codes and only four likely to begin doing so within twelve  months of taking the survey.
2020	Significant contributing factors cited by respondents included lack  of awareness and interest on the part of both patrons and staff, along with a belief that the  requirement for a smart phone excludes too many patrons � indicating that barriers that existed  when QR codes were first introduced over twenty years ago remain an issue.
